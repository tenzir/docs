#### Add an operator for partition candidate checks

[Section titled “Add an operator for partition candidate checks”](#add-an-operator-for-partition-candidate-checks)

The `partitions [<expr>]` source operator supersedes `show partitions` (now deprecated) and supports an optional expression as a positional argument for showing only the partitions that would be considered in `export | where <expr>`.
