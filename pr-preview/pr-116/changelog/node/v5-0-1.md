#### Fix bugs in `to_clickhouse` and improve diagnostics

[Section titled “Fix bugs in to\_clickhouse and improve diagnostics”](#fix-bugs-in-to_clickhouse-and-improve-diagnostics-1)

#### Keep the y-axis order for `chart_*` as specified

[Section titled “Keep the y-axis order for chart\_\* as specified”](#keep-the-y-axis-order-for-chart_-as-specified)

The `chart_*` operators no longer sort y-axes by their names. Instead, the user-provided order is used. For example, in `metrics "pipeline" | chart_bar x=timestamp, resolution=1d, y={"Ingress": ingress.bytes.sum(), "Egress": egress.bytes.sum()}` the field order is now “Ingress” followed by “Egress” as specified instead of the other way around.
