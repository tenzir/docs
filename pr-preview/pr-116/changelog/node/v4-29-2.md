### Features

[Section titled “Features”](#features)

#### Make debugging `load_tcp` pipelines easier

[Section titled “Make debugging load\_tcp pipelines easier”](#make-debugging-load_tcp-pipelines-easier)

The newly added `max_buffered_chunks` for `load_tcp` controls how many reads the operator schedules in advance on the socket. The option defaults to 10.

#### Improve panics to show stacktrace in diagnostics and logs

[Section titled “Improve panics to show stacktrace in diagnostics and logs”](#improve-panics-to-show-stacktrace-in-diagnostics-and-logs)

We have improved how internal errors are presented to the user, making it easier to report and analyze bugs.

### Bug Fixes

[Section titled “Bug Fixes”](#bug-fixes)

#### Ignore additional fields in package config

[Section titled “Ignore additional fields in package config”](#ignore-additional-fields-in-package-config)

Installing packages no longer fails when packages contain additional fields, and instead warns about the unexpected fields.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#5031](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5031).

#### Fix splitting logic for heterogeneous evaluation

[Section titled “Fix splitting logic for heterogeneous evaluation”](#fix-splitting-logic-for-heterogeneous-evaluation)

Expressions that have varying output types for the same input types (mostly the `parse_*` family of functions) no longer trigger an assertion on certain inputs.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#5043](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5043).

#### Fix hang in `cache` when creating an empty cache

[Section titled “Fix hang in cache when creating an empty cache”](#fix-hang-in-cache-when-creating-an-empty-cache)

The `cache` operator no longer hangs indefinitely when creating a new cache from a pipeline that returned zero events. For example, the pipeline `from {} | head 0 | cache "whoops"` never exited before this fix.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#5042](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5042).

#### Avoid idle wakeups in `load_tcp`

[Section titled “Avoid idle wakeups in load\_tcp”](#avoid-idle-wakeups-in-load_tcp)

We fixed a bug that caused unnecessary idle wakeups in the `load_tcp` operator, throwing off scheduling of pipelines using it. Under rare circumstances, this could also lead to partially duplicated output of the operator’s nested pipeline.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#5035](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5035).

#### Fix cache eviction always happening on maximally large caches

[Section titled “Fix cache eviction always happening on maximally large caches”](#fix-cache-eviction-always-happening-on-maximally-large-caches)

We fixed a bug in the `cache` operator that caused caches that were capped just short of the `tenzir.cache.capacity` option to still get evicted immediately.

By [@Avaq](https://github.com/Avaq) in [#5039](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5039).

#### Fix mismatch in type metadata after assignments

[Section titled “Fix mismatch in type metadata after assignments”](#fix-mismatch-in-type-metadata-after-assignments)

We fixed a bug that caused a loss of type names for nested fields in assignments, causing field metadata in `write_feather` and `write_parquet` to be missing.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#5033](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5033).

#### Change how signed ints are rendered in logs

[Section titled “Change how signed ints are rendered in logs”](#change-how-signed-ints-are-rendered-in-logs)

We fixed a bug in the `from_fluent_bit` and `to_fluent_bit` operators that caused positive integer options to be forwarded with a leading `+`. For example, `options={port: 9200}` forwarded the option `port=+9200` to Fluent Bit.
