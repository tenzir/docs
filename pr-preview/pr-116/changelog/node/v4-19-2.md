#### Add new expert-only options to control demand

[Section titled “Add new expert-only options to control demand”](#add-new-expert-only-options-to-control-demand)

We’ve made some changes that optimize Tenzir’s memory usage. Pipeline operators that emit very small batches of events or bytes at a high frequency now use less memory. The `serve` operator’s internal buffer is now soft-capped at 1Ki instead of 64Ki events, aligning the buffer size with the default upper limit for the number of events that can be fetched at once from `/serve`. The `export`, `metrics`, and `diagnostics` operators now handle back pressure better and utilize less memory in situations where the node has many small partitions. For expert users, the new `tenzir.demand` configuration section allows for controlling how eagerly operators demand input from their upstream operators. Lowering the demand reduces the peak memory usage of pipelines at some performance cost.

The `subscribe` operator now delivers metrics more consistently.
