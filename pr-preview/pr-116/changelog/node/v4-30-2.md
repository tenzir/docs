#### Fix fluentbit engine stop logic and disable TLS default

[Section titled “Fix fluentbit engine stop logic and disable TLS default”](#fix-fluentbit-engine-stop-logic-and-disable-tls-default)

Fixed an error in the `{from,to}_fluent_bit` operators that would cause it to fail to start successfully when using an input plugin (in particular the `elasticsearch` plugin) when the TLS setting was enabled without specifying a keyfile.
