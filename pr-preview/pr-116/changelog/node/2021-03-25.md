Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/releases/tag/2021.03.25).

### Features

[Section titled “Features”](#features)

#### PRs 1407-1487-1490

[Section titled “PRs 1407-1487-1490”](#prs-1407-1487-1490)

The schema language now supports 4 operations on record types: `+` combines the fields of 2 records into a new record. `<+` and `+>` are variations of `+` that give precedence to the left and right operand respectively. `-` creates a record with the field specified as its right operand removed.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#1407](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1407).

#### Support nested records in the Arrow Builder

[Section titled “Support nested records in the Arrow Builder”](#support-nested-records-in-the-arrow-builder)

VAST now supports nested records in Arrow table slices and in the JSON import, e.g., data of type `list<record<name: string, age: count>`. While nested record fields are not yet queryable, ingesting such data will no longer cause VAST to crash. MessagePack table slices don’t support records in lists yet.

### Changes

[Section titled “Changes”](#changes)

#### Move zeek-to-vast from tenzir/vast to tenzir/zeek-vast

[Section titled “Move zeek-to-vast from tenzir/vast to tenzir/zeek-vast”](#move-zeek-to-vast-from-tenzirvast-to-tenzirzeek-vast)

The zeek-to-vast utility was moved to the [tenzir/zeek-vast](https://github.com/tenzir/zeek-vast) repository. All options related to zeek-to-vast and the bundled Broker submodule were removed.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1435](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1435).

#### PRs 1408-satta

[Section titled “PRs 1408-satta”](#prs-1408-satta)

VAST now ships with schema record types for Suricata’s `mqtt` and `anomaly` event types.

By [@satta](https://github.com/satta) in [#1408](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1408).

#### Deprecate the vast.no-default-schema option

[Section titled “Deprecate the vast.no-default-schema option”](#deprecate-the-vastno-default-schema-option)

The option `vast.no-default-schema` is deprecated, as it is no longer needed to override types from bundled schemas.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1409](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1409).

#### PRs 1445-1452

[Section titled “PRs 1445-1452”](#prs-1445-1452)

Plugins can now be linked statically against VAST. A new `VASTRegisterPlugin` CMake function enables easy setup of the build scaffolding required for plugins. Configure with `--with-static-plugins` or build a static binary to link all plugins built alongside VAST statically. All plugin build scaffoldings must be adapted, older plugins do no longer work.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1445](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1445).

#### Rename the attribute\_extractor to meta\_extractor

[Section titled “Rename the attribute\_extractor to meta\_extractor”](#rename-the-attribute_extractor-to-meta_extractor)

The previously deprecated `#timestamp` extractor has been removed from the query language entirely. Use `:timestamp` instead.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#1399](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1399).

#### Establish subtyping relationships for type extractors

[Section titled “Establish subtyping relationships for type extractors”](#establish-subtyping-relationships-for-type-extractors)

The type extractor in the expression language now works with type aliases. For example, given the type definition for port from the base schema `type port = count`, a search for `:count` will also consider fields of type `port`.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#1446](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1446).

#### Change the default batch size to 1024

[Section titled “Change the default batch size to 1024”](#change-the-default-batch-size-to-1024)

The default size of table slices (event batches) that is created from `vast import` processes has been changed from 1,000 to 1,024.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#1396](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1396).

#### Prune expressions for the meta index lookup

[Section titled “Prune expressions for the meta index lookup”](#prune-expressions-for-the-meta-index-lookup)

Query latency for expressions that contain concept names has improved substantially. For DB sizes in the TB region, and with a large variety of event types, queries with a high selectivity experience speedups of up to 5x.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#1433](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1433).

### Bug Fixes

[Section titled “Bug Fixes”](#bug-fixes)

#### Remove erased partitions from the meta index

[Section titled “Remove erased partitions from the meta index”](#remove-erased-partitions-from-the-meta-index)

The disk monitor now correctly erases partition synopses from the meta index.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#1450](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1450).

#### Fix printing of non-null intrusive pointers

[Section titled “Fix printing of non-null intrusive pointers”](#fix-printing-of-non-null-intrusive-pointers)

Some non-null pointers were incorrectly rendered as `*nullptr` in log messages.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#1430](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1430).

#### Don’t allow field extractors to match field name suffixes

[Section titled “Don’t allow field extractors to match field name suffixes”](#dont-allow-field-extractors-to-match-field-name-suffixes)

A query for a field or field name suffix that matches multiple fields of different types would erroneously return no results.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#1447](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1447).

#### Fix possibly unhandled exception in disk monitor

[Section titled “Fix possibly unhandled exception in disk monitor”](#fix-possibly-unhandled-exception-in-disk-monitor)

VAST no longer crashes when the disk monitor tries to calculate the size of the database while files are being deleted. Instead, it will retry after the configured scan interval.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1458](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1458).

#### Make the disk-monitor a singleton component

[Section titled “Make the disk-monitor a singleton component”](#make-the-disk-monitor-a-singleton-component)

Enabling the disk budget feature no longer prevents the server process from exiting after it was stopped.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#1495](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1495).

#### Use non-throwing std::filesystem functions in the type registry

[Section titled “Use non-throwing std::filesystem functions in the type registry”](#use-non-throwing-stdfilesystem-functions-in-the-type-registry)

Insufficient permissions for one of the paths in the `schema-dirs` option would lead to a crash in `vast start`.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#1472](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1472).

#### PRs 1473-1485

[Section titled “PRs 1473-1485”](#prs-1473-1485)

A race condition during server shutdown could lead to an invariant violation, resulting in a firing assertion. Streamlining the shutdown logic resolved the issue.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#1473](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1473).

#### Report metrics while idle

[Section titled “Report metrics while idle”](#report-metrics-while-idle)

The archive, index, source, and sink components now report metrics when idle instead of omitting them entirely. This allows for distinguishing between idle and not running components from the metrics.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1451](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1451).

#### Fix :timestamp queries for old data

[Section titled “Fix :timestamp queries for old data”](#fix-timestamp-queries-for-old-data)

Data that was ingested before the deprecation of the `#timestamp` attribute wasn’t exported correctly with newer versions. This is now corrected.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#1432](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1432).

#### Accept numbers in place of strings in JSON

[Section titled “Accept numbers in place of strings in JSON”](#accept-numbers-in-place-of-strings-in-json)

The JSON parser now accepts data with numerical or boolean values in fields that expect strings according to the schema. VAST converts these values into string representations.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#1439](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1439).
