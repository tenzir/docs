[Section titled “Features”](#features)

[Section titled “Add support for reading and writing YAML documents”](#add-support-for-reading-and-writing-yaml-documents)

The `yaml` format supports reading and writing YAML documents and streams.

#### PRs 3461-fluent-bit

[Section titled “PRs 3461-fluent-bit”](#prs-3461-fluent-bit)

The new `fluent-bit` source and sink operator provide and interface to the Fluent Bit ecosystem. The source operator maps to a Fluent Bit *input* and the sink operator to a Fluent Bit *output*.

#### Add pipeline label support to the main repository

[Section titled “Add pipeline label support to the main repository”](#add-pipeline-label-support-to-the-main-repository)

The pipeline manager now supports user-provided labels for pipelines.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#3541](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3541).

#### Improve `json` parser, add `null` type, and various fixes

[Section titled “Improve json parser, add null type, and various fixes”](#improve-json-parser-add-null-type-and-various-fixes)

The performance of the `json`, `suricata` and `zeek-json` parsers was improved.

The `json` parser has a new `--raw` flag, which uses the raw type of JSON values instead of trying to infer one. For example, strings with ip addresses are given the type `string` instead of `ip`.

A dedicated `null` type was added.

Empty records are now allowed. Operators that previously discarded empty records (for example, `drop`) now preserve them.

### Changes

[Section titled “Changes”](#changes)

#### Disable dense indexes

[Section titled “Disable dense indexes”](#disable-dense-indexes)

Tenzir no longer builds dense indexes for imported events. Dense indexes improved query performance at the cost of a higher memory usage. However, over time the performance improvement became smaller due to other improvements in the underlying storage engine.

Tenzir no longer supports models in taxonomies. Since Tenzir v4.0 they were only supported in the deprecated `tenzir-ctl export` and `tenzir-ctl count` commands. We plan to bring the functionality back in the future with more powerful expressions in TQL.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3552](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3552).

#### Disable 0mq socket lingering

[Section titled “Disable 0mq socket lingering”](#disable-0mq-socket-lingering)

We made it easier to reuse the default `zmq` socket endpoint by disabling *socket lingering*, and thereby immediately relinquishing resources when terminating a ZeroMQ pipeline. Changing the linger period from infinite to 0 no longer buffers pending messages in memory after closing a ZeroMQ socket.

### Bug Fixes

[Section titled “Bug Fixes”](#bug-fixes)

#### Fix timing-related crashes in the `web` plugin

[Section titled “Fix timing-related crashes in the web plugin”](#fix-timing-related-crashes-in-the-web-plugin)

The web server will not crash when receiving requests during shutdown anymore.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#3553](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3553).

#### Change type of `version` in `suricata.quic` to `string`

[Section titled “Change type of version in suricata.quic to string”](#change-type-of-version-in-suricataquic-to-string)

The type of the `quic.version` field in the built-in `suricata.quic` schema was fixed. It now is a string instead of an integer.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#3533](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3533).

#### Implement serialization\_plugins for store\_plugins

[Section titled “Implement serialization\_plugins for store\_plugins”](#implement-serialization_plugins-for-store_plugins)

The `parquet` and `feather` formats no longer throw assertions during normal usage anymore.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#3537](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3537).

#### Fix the wrong type for the version record type in the `zeek.software` schema

[Section titled “Fix the wrong type for the version record type in the zeek.software schema”](#fix-the-wrong-type-for-the-version-record-type-in-the-zeeksoftware-schema)

The `zeek.software` does not contain an incomplete `version` record type anymore.

The `version.minor` type in the `zeek.software` schema is now a `uint64` instead of a `double` to comply with Zeek’s version structure.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#3538](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3538).

#### Improve `json` parser, add `null` type, and various fixes

[Section titled “Improve json parser, add null type, and various fixes”](#improve-json-parser-add-null-type-and-various-fixes-1)

The `json`, `suricata` and `zeek-json` parsers are now more stable and should now parse all inputs correctly.

`null` records are no longer incorrectly transformed into records with `null` fields anymore.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#3503](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3503).

#### Fix processing of http arguments

[Section titled “Fix processing of http arguments”](#fix-processing-of-http-arguments)

The `http` loader no longer ignores the value user-provided custom headers.
