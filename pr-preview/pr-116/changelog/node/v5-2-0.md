# Watching Directories

Tenzir Node v5.2 brings our most requested feature to life, adding the ability to watch a local filesystem directory or a blob storage bucket for new files within a pipeline.

Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/releases/tag/v5.2.0).

### Features

[Section titled “Features”](#features)

#### Add `from_file` operator

[Section titled “Add from\_file operator”](#add-from_file-operator)

The new `from_file` operator can be used to read multiple files from a potentially remote filesystem using globbing expressions. It also supports watching for new files and deletion after a file has been read.

`read_lines` now has an additional `binary=true` option which should be used if the incoming byte stream is not valid UTF-8.
