### Features

[Section titled “Features”](#features)

#### Move PCAP import/export into a plugin

[Section titled “Move PCAP import/export into a plugin”](#move-pcap-importexport-into-a-plugin)

*Reader Plugins* and *Writer Plugins* are a new family of plugins that add import/export formats. The previously optional PCAP format moved into a dedicated plugin. Configure with `--with-pcap-plugin` and add `pcap` to `vast.plugins` to enable the PCAP plugin.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1549](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1549).

#### PRs 1532-1541

[Section titled “PRs 1532-1541”](#prs-1532-1541)

The `VAST_PLUGIN_DIRS` and `VAST_SCHEMA_DIRS` environment variables allow for setting additional plugin and schema directories separated with `:` with higher precedence than other plugin and schema directories.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1532](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1532).

#### Allow for building plugins separately from VAST

[Section titled “Allow for building plugins separately from VAST”](#allow-for-building-plugins-separately-from-vast)

It is now possible to build plugins against an installed VAST. This requires a slight adaptation to every plugin’s build scaffolding. The example plugin was updated accordingly.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1532](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1532).

#### Add ‘—disk-budget-check-binary’ option to disk monitor

[Section titled “Add ‘—disk-budget-check-binary’ option to disk monitor”](#add-disk-budget-check-binary-option-to-disk-monitor)

The disk monitor gained a new `vast.start.disk-budget-check-binary` option that can be used to specify an external binary to determine the size of the database directory. This can be useful in cases where `stat()` does not give the correct answer, e.g. on compressed filesystems.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#1453](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1453).

#### PRs 1544-1547-1588

[Section titled “PRs 1544-1547-1588”](#prs-1544-1547-1588)

*Component Plugins* are a new category of plugins that execute code within the VAST server process. *Analyzer Plugins* are now a specialization of *Component Plugins*, and their API remains unchanged.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1544](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1544).

### Changes

[Section titled “Changes”](#changes)

#### Make the source a regular class

[Section titled “Make the source a regular class”](#make-the-source-a-regular-class)

The metrics for Suricata Eve JSON and Zeek Streaming JSON imports are now under the categories `suricata-reader` and `zeek-reader` respectively so they can be distinguished from the regular JSON import, which is still under `json-reader`.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#1498](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1498).

#### Small fixes for projections

[Section titled “Small fixes for projections”](#small-fixes-for-projections)

The Suricata `dns` schema type now defines the `dns.grouped.A` field containing a list of all returned addresses.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#1531](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1531).

#### Upstream Debian patches

[Section titled “Upstream Debian patches”](#upstream-debian-patches)

We upstreamed the Debian patches provided by [@satta](https://github.com/satta). VAST now prefers an installed `tsl-robin-map>=0.6.2` to the bundled one unless configured with `--with-bundled-robin-map`, and we provide a manpage for `lsvast` if `pandoc` is installed.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1515](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1515).

#### Remove deprecated no-default-schema option

[Section titled “Remove deprecated no-default-schema option”](#remove-deprecated-no-default-schema-option)

The previously deprecated ([#1409](https://github.com/tenzir/vast/pull/1409)) option `vast.no-default-schema` no longer exists.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1507](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1507).

#### Use individual files for changelog entries

[Section titled “Use individual files for changelog entries”](#use-individual-files-for-changelog-entries)

Building VAST now requires CMake >= 3.15.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1559](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1559).

#### Align plugin and library output names

[Section titled “Align plugin and library output names”](#align-plugin-and-library-output-names)

Plugins configured via `vast.plugins` in the configuration file can now be specified using either the plugin name or the full path to the shared plugin library. We no longer allow omitting the extension from specified plugin files, and recommend using the plugin name as a more portable solution, e.g., `example` over `libexample` and `/path/to/libexample.so` over `/path/to/libexample`.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1527](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1527).

#### Prefix plugin library output names with vast-plugin-

[Section titled “Prefix plugin library output names with vast-plugin-”](#prefix-plugin-library-output-names-with-vast-plugin)

To avoid confusion between the PCAP plugin and libpcap, which both have a library file named `libpcap.so`, we now generally prefix the plugin library output names with `vast-plugin-`. E.g., The PCAP plugin library file is now named `libvast-plugin-pcap.so`. Plugins specified with a full path in the configuration under `vast.plugins` must be adapted accordingly.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1593](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1593).

#### Make it possible to run VAST without user configs

[Section titled “Make it possible to run VAST without user configs”](#make-it-possible-to-run-vast-without-user-configs)

The new option `--disable-default-config-dirs` disables the loading of user and system configuration, schema, and plugin directories. We use this option internally when running integration tests.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1557](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1557).

#### Update chat URL in README

[Section titled “Update chat URL in README”](#update-chat-url-in-readme)

The VAST community chat moved from Element to Gitter. Join us at [gitter.im/tenzir/vast](https://gitter.im/tenzir/vast) or via Matrix at `#tenzir_vast:gitter.im`.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1591](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1591).

#### PRs 1514-1574

[Section titled “PRs 1514-1574”](#prs-1514-1574)

The `exporter.hits` metric has been removed.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#1514](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1514).

#### PRs 1499-satta

[Section titled “PRs 1499-satta”](#prs-1499-satta)

VAST now ships with a schema record type for Suricata’s `rfb` event type.

By [@satta](https://github.com/satta) in [#1499](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1499).

#### Remove deprecated format-specific options

[Section titled “Remove deprecated format-specific options”](#remove-deprecated-format-specific-options)

The previously deprecated usage ([#1354](https://github.com/tenzir/vast/pull/1354)) of format-independent options after the format in commands is now no longer possible. This affects the options `listen`, `read`, `schema`, `schema-file`, `type`, and `uds` for import commands and the `write` and `uds` options for export commands.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1529](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1529).

#### Factor common functionality in component plugin

[Section titled “Factor common functionality in component plugin”](#factor-common-functionality-in-component-plugin)

The status output of *Analyzer Plugins* moved from the `importer.analyzers` key into the top-level record.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1544](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1544).

#### Move PCAP import/export into a plugin

[Section titled “Move PCAP import/export into a plugin”](#move-pcap-importexport-into-a-plugin-1)

Plugins must define a separate entrypoint in their build scaffolding using the argument `ENTRYPOINT` to the CMake function `VASTRegisterPlugin`. If only a single value is given to the argument `SOURCES`, it is interpreted as the `ENTRYPOINT` automatically.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1549](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1549).

### Bug Fixes

[Section titled “Bug Fixes”](#bug-fixes)

#### Handle alias types properly for CSV

[Section titled “Handle alias types properly for CSV”](#handle-alias-types-properly-for-csv)

The CSV reader no longer crashes when encountering nested type aliases.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1534](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1534).

#### Move PCAP import/export into a plugin

[Section titled “Move PCAP import/export into a plugin”](#move-pcap-importexport-into-a-plugin-2)

Plugin unit tests now correctly load and initialize their respective plugins.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1549](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1549).

#### Fix start command detection for spdlog

[Section titled “Fix start command detection for spdlog”](#fix-start-command-detection-for-spdlog)

Custom commands from plugins ending in `start` no longer try to write to the server instead of the client log file.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1530](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1530).

#### Ignore spaces before SI prefixes

[Section titled “Ignore spaces before SI prefixes”](#ignore-spaces-before-si-prefixes)

Spaces before SI prefixes in command line arguments and configuration options are now generally ignored, e.g., it is now possible to set the disk monitor budgets to `2 GiB` rather than `2GiB`.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1590](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1590).

#### Multiple node shutdown fixes

[Section titled “Multiple node shutdown fixes”](#multiple-node-shutdown-fixes)

The shutdown logic contained a bug that would make the node fail to terminate in case a plugin actor is registered at said node.

A race condition in the shutdown logic that caused an assertion was fixed.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#1563](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1563).

#### Fix exporter.selectivity for idle periods

[Section titled “Fix exporter.selectivity for idle periods”](#fix-exporterselectivity-for-idle-periods)

The `exporter.selectivity` metric is now 1.0 instead of NaN for idle periods.

VAST no longer renders JSON numbers with non-finite numbers as `NaN`, `-NaN`, `inf`, or `-inf`, resulting in invalid JSON output. Instead, such numbers are now rendered as `null`.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1574](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1574).

#### Deduplicate plugin entrypoint in sources

[Section titled “Deduplicate plugin entrypoint in sources”](#deduplicate-plugin-entrypoint-in-sources)

We fixed a regression that made it impossible to build static binaries from outside of the repository root directory.

The `VASTRegisterPlugin` CMake function now correctly removes the `ENTRYPOINT` from the given `SOURCES`, allowing for plugin developers to easily glob for sources again.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1573](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1573).

#### Use proper full install dirs for system config

[Section titled “Use proper full install dirs for system config”](#use-proper-full-install-dirs-for-system-config)

Specifying relative `CMAKE_INSTALL_*DIR` in the build configuration no longer causes VAST not to pick up system-wide installed configuration files, schemas, and plugins. The configured install prefix is now used correctly. The defunct `VAST_SYSCONFDIR`, `VAST_DATADIR`, and `VAST_LIBDIR` CMake options no longer exist. Use a combination of `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` and `CMAKE_INSTALL_*DIR` instead.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1580](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1580).

#### Fix building VAST within a shallow git tree

[Section titled “Fix building VAST within a shallow git tree”](#fix-building-vast-within-a-shallow-git-tree)

VAST now correctly builds within shallow clones of the repository. If the build system is unable to determine the correct version from `git-describe`, it now always falls back to the version of the last release.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1570](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1570).

#### Avoid shutdown when config dirs are not readable

[Section titled “Avoid shutdown when config dirs are not readable”](#avoid-shutdown-when-config-dirs-are-not-readable)

VAST no longer refuses to start when any of the configuration file directories is unreadable, e.g., because VAST is running in a sandbox.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1533](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1533).

#### Ignore static plugins when specified in config

[Section titled “Ignore static plugins when specified in config”](#ignore-static-plugins-when-specified-in-config)

VAST no longer erroneously tries to load explicitly specified plugins dynamically that are linked statically.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1528](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1528).

#### Fix the timezone shift to UTC for ISO8601 dates

[Section titled “Fix the timezone shift to UTC for ISO8601 dates”](#fix-the-timezone-shift-to-utc-for-iso8601-dates)

A bug in the parsing of ISO8601 formatted dates that incorrectly adjusted the time to the UTC timezone has been fixed.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#1537](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1537).

#### Allow for building plugins separately from VAST

[Section titled “Allow for building plugins separately from VAST”](#allow-for-building-plugins-separately-from-vast-1)

Linking against an installed VAST via CMake now correctly resolves VAST’s dependencies.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1532](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1532).

#### Fix out-of-bounds access in command-line parser

[Section titled “Fix out-of-bounds access in command-line parser”](#fix-out-of-bounds-access-in-command-line-parser)

The command-line parser no longer crashes when encountering a flag with missing value in the last position of a command invocation.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#1536](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1536).
