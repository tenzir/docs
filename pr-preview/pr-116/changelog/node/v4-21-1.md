### Bug Fixes

[Section titled “Bug Fixes”](#bug-fixes)

#### Switch the index to basic messaging

[Section titled “Switch the index to basic messaging”](#switch-the-index-to-basic-messaging)

We fixed a bug that sometimes caused the `tenzir-node` process to hang on shutdown. This was most likely to happen when the node shut down immediately after starting up, e.g., because of an invalid configuration file.

#### Fix double-closing fds in the python operator

[Section titled “Fix double-closing fds in the python operator”](#fix-double-closing-fds-in-the-python-operator)

#### Fix incorrect context updates count in lookup metrics

[Section titled “Fix incorrect context updates count in lookup metrics”](#fix-incorrect-context-updates-count-in-lookup-metrics)

We fixed a bug that caused the `context_updates` field in `metrics lookup` to be reported once per field specified in the corresponding `lookup` operator instead of being reported once per operator in total.
