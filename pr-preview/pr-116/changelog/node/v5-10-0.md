### Features

[Section titled “Features”](#features)

#### Improved node robustness

[Section titled “Improved node robustness”](#improved-node-robustness)

We added an experimental feature to run node-independent operators of a pipeline in dedicated subprocesses. This brings improved error resilience and resource utilization. You can opt-in to this feature with the setting `tenzir.disable-pipeline-subprocesses: false` in `tenzir.yaml`. We plan to enable this feature by default in the future.

#### Operations on concatenated secrets

[Section titled “Operations on concatenated secrets”](#operations-on-concatenated-secrets)

You can now arbitrarily nest operations on secrets. This is useful for APIs that expect authentication is an encoded blob:

```tql
let $headers = {
  auth: f"{secret("user")}:{secret("password")}".encode_base64()
}
```

#### New string padding functions

[Section titled “New string padding functions”](#new-string-padding-functions)

Ever tried aligning threat actor names in your incident reports? Or formatting CVE IDs with consistent spacing for your vulnerability dashboard? We’ve all been there, fighting with inconsistent string lengths that make our security tools output look like alphabet soup. 🍲

Meet your new formatting friends: `pad_start()` and `pad_end()`!

#### Live Threat Feed Dashboard

[Section titled “Live Threat Feed Dashboard”](#live-threat-feed-dashboard)

Create a real-time threat indicator board with perfectly aligned columns:

```tql
from {time: "14:32", actor: "APT29", target: "energy", severity: 9},
     {time: "14:35", actor: "Lazarus", target: "finance", severity: 10},
     {time: "14:41", actor: "APT1", target: "defense", severity: 8}
select threat_line = time + " │ " + actor.pad_end(12) + " │ " +
                     target.pad_end(10) + " │ " + severity.string().pad_start(2, "0")
write_lines
```

```plaintext
14:32 │ APT29        │ energy     │ 09
14:35 │ Lazarus      │ finance    │ 10
14:41 │ APT1         │ defense    │ 08
```

#### CVE Priority Matrix

[Section titled “CVE Priority Matrix”](#cve-priority-matrix)

Format CVE IDs and CVSS scores for your vulnerability management system:

```tql
from {cve: "CVE-2024-1337", score: 9.8, vector: "network", status: "🔴"},
     {cve: "CVE-2024-42", score: 7.2, vector: "local", status: "🟡"},
     {cve: "CVE-2024-31415", score: 5.4, vector: "physical", status: "🟢"}
select priority = status + " " + cve.pad_end(16) + " [" +
                  score.string().pad_start(4) + "] " + vector.pad_start(10, "·")
write_lines
```

```plaintext
🔴 CVE-2024-1337    [ 9.8] ···network
🟡 CVE-2024-42      [ 7.2] ·····local
🟢 CVE-2024-31415   [ 5.4] ··physical
```

#### Network Flow Analysis

[Section titled “Network Flow Analysis”](#network-flow-analysis)

Build clean firewall logs with aligned source/destination pairs:

```tql
from {src: "10.0.0.5", dst: "8.8.8.8", proto: "DNS", bytes: 234},
     {src: "192.168.1.100", dst: "13.107.42.14", proto: "HTTPS", bytes: 8924},
     {src: "172.16.0.50", dst: "185.199.108.153", proto: "SSH", bytes: 45812}
select flow = src.pad_start(15) + " → " + dst.pad_start(15) +
              " [" + proto.pad_end(5) + "] " + bytes.string().pad_start(7) + " B"
write_lines
```

```plaintext
       10.0.0.5 →         8.8.8.8 [DNS  ]     234 B
  192.168.1.100 →    13.107.42.14 [HTTPS]    8924 B
    172.16.0.50 → 185.199.108.153 [SSH  ]   45812 B
```

Both padding functions accept three parameters:

* **String to pad** (required)
* **Target length** (required)
* **Padding character** (optional, defaults to space)

If your string is already longer than the target length, it returns unchanged. Multi-character padding? That’s a paddlin’ (returns an error).

Your SOC dashboards never looked so clean! 🎯

#### Sinks in HTTP Parsing Pipelines

[Section titled “Sinks in HTTP Parsing Pipelines”](#sinks-in-http-parsing-pipelines)

Parsing pipeline in the `from_http` and `http` operators now support sinks. This worked already in `from_file` parsing pipelines and now works, as expected, also in the HTTP parsing pipelines. For example, you can now write:

```tql
from_http "https://cra.circl.lu/opendata/geo-open/mmdb-country-asn/latest.mmdb" {
  context::load "geo-open-country-asn"
}
```

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#5343](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5343).

#### HTTP request body encoding

[Section titled “HTTP request body encoding”](#http-request-body-encoding)

The `from_http` and `http` operators now support using `record` values for the request `body` parameter. By default, the record is serialized as JSON. You can also specify `encode="form"` to send the body as URL-encoded form data. When using `form` encoding, nested fields are flattened using dot notation (e.g., `foo: {bar: "baz"}` => `foo.bar=baz`). This supersedes the `payload` parameter, which therefore is now deprecated.

###### Examples

[Section titled “Examples”](#examples)

By default, setting `body` to a record will JSON-encode it:

```tql
http "https://api.example.com/data", body={foo: "bar", count: 42}
```

```http
POST /data HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 33


{
  "foo": "bar",
  "count": 42
}
```

To change the encoding, you can use the `encode` option:

```tql
http "https://api.example.com/data",
  body={foo: {bar: "baz"}, count: 42},
  encode="form"
```

```http
POST /data HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 20


foo.bar=baz&count=42
```

Arbitrary body contents can be sent by using a string or blob:

```tql
http "https://api.example.com/data", body="hello world!"
```

```http
POST /data HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
Content-Length: 12


hello world!
```

#### IP address categorization functions

[Section titled “IP address categorization functions”](#ip-address-categorization-functions)

Ever wondered if that suspicious traffic is coming from inside the corporate network? 🏢 We’ve got you covered with a new suite of IP address classification functions that make network analysis a breeze.

**`is_private()`** - Quickly spot internal RFC 1918 addresses in your logs. Perfect for identifying lateral movement or distinguishing between internal and external threats:

```tql
where src_ip.is_private() and dst_ip.is_global()
// Catch data exfiltration attempts from your internal network
```

**`is_global()`** - Find publicly routable addresses. Essential for tracking external attackers or monitoring outbound connections:

```tql
where src_ip.is_global() and failed_login_count > 5
// Detect brute force attempts from the internet
```

**`is_multicast()`** - Identify multicast traffic (224.0.0.0/4, ff00::/8). Great for spotting mDNS, SSDP, and other broadcast protocols that shouldn’t cross network boundaries:

```tql
where dst_ip.is_multicast() and src_ip.is_global()
// Flag suspicious multicast from external sources
```

**`is_link_local()`** - Detect link-local addresses (169.254.0.0/16, fe80::/10). Useful for identifying misconfigurations or APIPA fallback:

```tql
where server_ip.is_link_local()
// Find services accidentally binding to link-local addresses
```

**`is_loopback()`** - Spot loopback addresses (127.0.0.0/8, ::1). Hunt for suspicious local connections or tunneled traffic:

```tql
where src_ip != dst_ip and dst_ip.is_loopback()
// Unusual loopback connections might indicate malware
```

**`ip_category()`** - Get the complete classification in one shot. Returns: “global”, “private”, “multicast”, “link\_local”, “loopback”, “broadcast”, or “unspecified”:

```tql
where src_ip.ip_category() == "private" and dst_ip.ip_category() == "multicast"
// Analyze traffic patterns by IP category
```

These functions work seamlessly with both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, making them future-proof for your dual-stack environments. Happy hunting! 🔍

#### `ocsf::trim` and `ocsf::derive`

[Section titled “ocsf::trim and ocsf::derive”](#ocsftrim-and-ocsfderive)

Tenzir now provides two new operators for processing OCSF events:

**`ocsf::derive`** automatically assigns enum strings from their integer counterparts and vice versa. It performs bidirectional enum derivation for OCSF events and validates consistency between existing enum values.

```tql
from {
  activity_id: 1,
  class_uid: 1001,
  metadata: {version: "1.5.0"},
}
ocsf::derive
```

This transforms the event to include the derived `activity_name: "Create"` and `class_name: "File System Activity"` fields.

**`ocsf::trim`** intelligently removes fields from OCSF events to reduce data size while preserving essential information. You can also have explicit control over optional and recommended field removal.

```tql
from {
  class_uid: 3002,
  class_name: "Authentication",
  user: {
    name: "alice",
    display_name: "Alice",
  },
  status: "Success",
}
ocsf::trim
```

This removes non-essential fields like `class_name` and `user.display_name` while keeping critical information intact.

#### Compression for `write_bitz`

[Section titled “Compression for write\_bitz”](#compression-for-write_bitz)

Tenzir’s internal wire format, which is accessible through the `read_bitz` and `write_bitz` operators, now uses Zstd compression internally, resulting in a significantly smaller output size. This change is backwards-compatible.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#5335](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5335).

### Changes

[Section titled “Changes”](#changes)

#### Better query optimization

[Section titled “Better query optimization”](#better-query-optimization)

Previously, queries that used `export` followed by a `where` that used fields such as `this["field name"]` were not optimized. Now, the same optimizations apply as with normal fields, improving the performance of such queries.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#5362](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5362).

#### Improved `join` behavior

[Section titled “Improved join behavior”](#improved-join-behavior)

The `join` function now also works with empty lists that are typed as `list<null>`. Furthermore, it now emits more helpful warnings.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#5356](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5356).

#### Respecting error responses from Azure Log Analytics

[Section titled “Respecting error responses from Azure Log Analytics”](#respecting-error-responses-from-azure-log-analytics)

The `to_azure_log_analytics` operator now emits an error when it receives any response considering an internal error. Those normally indicate configuration errors and the pipeline will now stop with an error instead of continuing to send data that will not be received correctly.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#5314](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5314).

#### Renamed `to_asl`

[Section titled “Renamed to\_asl”](#renamed-to_asl)

We renamed our Amazon Security Lake integration operator from `to_asl` to `to_amazon_security_lake`. The old name is now deprecated and will be removed in the future.

By [@IyeOnline](https://github.com/IyeOnline) in [#5340](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5340).

#### `kv` parser no longer produces empty fields

[Section titled “kv parser no longer produces empty fields”](#kv-parser-no-longer-produces-empty-fields)

Our Key-Value parsers (the `read_kv` operator and `parse_kv` function) previously produced empty values if the `value_split` was not found.

With this change, a “field” missing a `value_split` is considered an extension of the previous fields value instead:

```tql
from \
  {input: "x=1 y=2 z=3 4 5 a=6"},
this = { ...input.parse_kv() }
```

Previous result:

```tql
{x:1, y:2, z:"3", "4":"", "5":"", a:6}
```

New result:

```tql
{x:1, y:2, z:"3 4 5", a:6}
```

### Bug Fixes

[Section titled “Bug Fixes”](#bug-fixes)

#### Non-default databases in `to_clickhouse`

[Section titled “Non-default databases in to\_clickhouse”](#non-default-databases-in-to_clickhouse)

The `to_clickhouse` operator erroneously rejected `table` arguments of the form `database_name.table_name`. This is now fixed, allowing you to write to non-default databases.

By [@IyeOnline](https://github.com/IyeOnline) in [#5355](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5355).

#### Remove file size limit from Amazon Security Lake Integration

[Section titled “Remove file size limit from Amazon Security Lake Integration”](#remove-file-size-limit-from-amazon-security-lake-integration)

We removed the 256MB file size limit from the Amazon Security Lake integration.

By [@IyeOnline](https://github.com/IyeOnline) in [#5340](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5340).

#### Newlines before `else`

[Section titled “Newlines before else”](#newlines-before-else)

Previously, the `if … { … } else { … }` construct required that there was no newline before `else`. This restriction is now lifted, which allows placing `else` at the beginning of the line:

```tql
if x { … }
else if y { … }
else { … }
```

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#5348](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5348).

#### Fixed `encrypt_cryptopan` function

[Section titled “Fixed encrypt\_cryptopan function”](#fixed-encrypt_cryptopan-function)

We fixed a bug that sometimes caused the `encrypt_cryptopan` function to fail with the error “got `ip`, expected `ip`”, which was caused by an incorrect type check. The function now works as expected again.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#5345](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5345).

#### Fixed `list_separator` option name in `print_csv`

[Section titled “Fixed list\_separator option name in print\_csv”](#fixed-list_separator-option-name-in-print_csv)

The `print_csv`, `print_ssv` and `print_tsv` functions had an option incorrectly named `field_separator`. Instead, these functions have an option `list_separator` now, allowing you to change the list separator. You cannot set a custom `field_separator` on these functions. If you want to print with custom `field_separator`s, use `print_xsv` instead.

By [@IyeOnline](https://github.com/IyeOnline) in [#5357](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5357).

#### Fix `context::create_geoip` without `db_path`

[Section titled “Fix context::create\_geoip without db\_path”](#fix-contextcreate_geoip-without-db_path)

The `context::create_geoip` operator failed with a `message_mismatch` error when no `db_path` option was provided. This was caused by an internal serialization error, which we now fixed. This is the only known place where this error occurred.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#5342](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5342).

#### Fix `http` operator pagination

[Section titled “Fix http operator pagination”](#fix-http-operator-pagination)

The `http` operator dropped all provided HTTP headers after the first request when performing paginated requests. The operator now preserves the headers for all requests.
