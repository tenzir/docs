### Features

[Section titled “Features”](#features)

#### Add a few new aggregation functions for TQL2

[Section titled “Add a few new aggregation functions for TQL2”](#add-a-few-new-aggregation-functions-for-tql2)

We added three new, TQL2-exclusive aggregation functions: `first`, `last`, and `mode`. The functions return the first, last, and most common non-null value per group, respectively.

### Bug Fixes

[Section titled “Bug Fixes”](#bug-fixes)

#### Implement `and` and `or` for `null_type`

[Section titled “Implement and and or for null\_type”](#implement-and-and-or-for-null_type)

The boolean operators `and`/`or` now work correctly for the type `null`. Previously, `null and false` evaluated to `null`, and a warning was emitted. Now, it evaluates to `false` without a warning.

#### Ensure cache directory is writable for multiple users

[Section titled “Ensure cache directory is writable for multiple users”](#ensure-cache-directory-is-writable-for-multiple-users)

Using the `tenzir` process from multiple users on the same host sometimes failed because the cache directory was not writable for all users. This no longer happens.

#### Return instantly in `/serve` if pipeline fails early

[Section titled “Return instantly in /serve if pipeline fails early”](#return-instantly-in-serve-if-pipeline-fails-early)

The `/serve` endpoint now returns instantly when its pipeline fails before the endpoint is used for the first time. In the Tenzir Platform this causes the load more button in the Explorer to correctly stop showing for pipelines that fail shortly after starting.
