#### Add MsgPack-based Table Slice implementation

[Section titled “Add MsgPack-based Table Slice implementation”](#add-msgpack-based-table-slice-implementation)

We open-sourced our [MessagePack](http://msgpack.org)-based table slice implementation, which provides a compact row-oriented encoding of data. This encoding works well for binary formats (e.g., PCAP) and access patterns that involve materializing entire rows. The MessagePack table slice is the new default when Apache Arrow is unavailable. To enable parsing into MessagePack, you can pass `--table-slice-type=msgpack` to the `import` command, or set the configuration option `import.table-slice-type` to `'msgpack'`.
