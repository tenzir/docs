#### Rebatch undersized batches when rebuilding partitions

[Section titled “Rebatch undersized batches when rebuilding partitions”](#rebatch-undersized-batches-when-rebuilding-partitions)

Rebuilding partitions now additionally rebatches the contained events to `vast.import.batch-size` events per batch, which accelerates queries against partitions that previously had undersized batches.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2583](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2583).

#### PRs 2513-2738

[Section titled “PRs 2513-2738”](#prs-2513-2738)

We now distribute VAST also as Debian Package with every new release. The Debian package automatically installs a systemd service and creates a `vast` user for the VAST process.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#2513](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2513).

#### Add “-total” metric keys for schema-dependent metrics

[Section titled “Add “-total” metric keys for schema-dependent metrics”](#add--total-metric-keys-for-schema-dependent-metrics)

VAST has three new metrics: `catalog.num-partitions-total`, `catalog.num-events-total`, and `ingest-total` that sum up all schema-based metrics by their respective schema-based metric counterparts.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#2682](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2682).

#### Disable building unit tests in Dockerfile

[Section titled “Disable building unit tests in Dockerfile”](#disable-building-unit-tests-in-dockerfile)

VAST Cloud can now expose HTTP services using Cloudflare Access.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2578](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2578).

#### Emit metrics from the filesystem actor

[Section titled “Emit metrics from the filesystem actor”](#emit-metrics-from-the-filesystem-actor)

VAST now emits metrics for filesystem access under the keys `posix-filesystem.{checks,writes,reads,mmaps,erases,moves}.{successful,failed,bytes}`.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2572](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2572).

#### Enable configuration of the zstd compression level for feather store

[Section titled “Enable configuration of the zstd compression level for feather store”](#enable-configuration-of-the-zstd-compression-level-for-feather-store)

VAST has a new configuration setting, `vast.zstd-compression-level`, to control the compression level of the Zstd algorithm used in both the Feather and Parquet store backends. The default level is set by the Apache Arrow library, and for Parquet is no longer explicitly defaulted to `9`.

By [@dispanser](https://github.com/dispanser) in [#2623](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2623).

#### PRs 2574-2652

[Section titled “PRs 2574-2652”](#prs-2574-2652)

### Changes

[Section titled “Changes”](#changes)

#### Move the version string into a central JSON file

[Section titled “Move the version string into a central JSON file”](#move-the-version-string-into-a-central-json-file)

Building VAST from source now requires CMake 3.19 or greater.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#2582](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2582).

#### Make `feather` the default store-backend

[Section titled “Make feather the default store-backend”](#make-feather-the-default-store-backend)

The default store backend of VAST is now `feather`. Reading from VAST’s custom `segment-store` backend is still transparently supported, but new partitions automatically write to the Apache Feather V2 backend instead.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2587](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2587).

#### Change default endpoint to 127.0.0.1

[Section titled “Change default endpoint to 127.0.0.1”](#change-default-endpoint-to-127001)

We changed the default VAST endpoint from `localhost` to `127.0.0.1`. This ensures the listening address is deterministic and not dependent on the host-specific IPv4 and IPv6 resolution. For example, resolving `localhost` yields a list of addresses, and if VAST fails to bind on the first (e.g., to due to a lingering socket) it would silently go to the next. Taking name resolution out of the equation fixes such issues. Set the option `vast.endpoint` to override the default endpoint.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#2512](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2512).

#### Load “all” plugins by default & allow “empty” values

[Section titled “Load “all” plugins by default & allow “empty” values”](#load-all-plugins-by-default--allow-empty-values)

VAST now loads all plugins by default. To revert to the old behavior, explicitly set the `vast.plugins` option to have no value.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#2689](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2689).

#### Add memory-usage to index and catalog telemetry reports

[Section titled “Add memory-usage to index and catalog telemetry reports”](#add-memory-usage-to-index-and-catalog-telemetry-reports)

VAST now emits per-component memory usage metrics under the keys `index.memory-usage` and `catalog.memory-usage`.

By [@patszt](https://github.com/patszt) in [#2471](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2471).

#### Remove PyVAST in favor of new Python bindings

[Section titled “Remove PyVAST in favor of new Python bindings”](#remove-pyvast-in-favor-of-new-python-bindings)

We removed PyVAST from the code base in favor of the new Python bindings. PyVAST continues to work as a thin wrapper around the VAST binary, but will no longer be released alongside VAST.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2674](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2674).

#### Rename `vast dump` to `vast show`

[Section titled “Rename vast dump to vast show”](#rename-vast-dump-to-vast-show)

The `vast dump` command is now called `vast show`.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2686](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2686).

#### Arrow 10.0.0 support

[Section titled “Arrow 10.0.0 support”](#arrow-1000-support)

Building VAST from source now requires [Apache Arrow 10.0](https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2022/10/31/10.0.0-release/) or newer.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#2685](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2685).

### Bug Fixes

[Section titled “Bug Fixes”](#bug-fixes)

#### Add a timeout to the UDS metric sink

[Section titled “Add a timeout to the UDS metric sink”](#add-a-timeout-to-the-uds-metric-sink)

The UDS metrics sink no longer deadlocks due to suspended listeners.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#2635](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2635).

#### Remove caf::skip usages

[Section titled “Remove caf::skip usages”](#remove-cafskip-usages)

Rebuilding of heterogeneous partition no longer freezes the entire rebuilder on pipeline failures.

By [@patszt](https://github.com/patszt) in [#2530](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2530).

#### Fix a connection error message

[Section titled “Fix a connection error message”](#fix-a-connection-error-message)

The error message on connection failure now contains a correctly formatted target endpoint.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#2609](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2609).

#### Remove the shutdown grace period

[Section titled “Remove the shutdown grace period”](#remove-the-shutdown-grace-period)

VAST no longer attempts to hard-kill itself if the shutdown did not finish within the configured grace period. The option `vast.shutdown-grace-period` no longer exists. We recommend setting `TimeoutStopSec=180` in the VAST systemd service definition to restore the previous behavior.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2568](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2568).

#### Don’t abort startup if individual partitions fail to load

[Section titled “Don’t abort startup if individual partitions fail to load”](#dont-abort-startup-if-individual-partitions-fail-to-load)

VAST now skips unreadable partitions while starting up, instead of aborting the initialization routine.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#2515](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2515).

#### Allow read access to user home dir in the systemd unit

[Section titled “Allow read access to user home dir in the systemd unit”](#allow-read-access-to-user-home-dir-in-the-systemd-unit)

The systemd service no longer fails if the home directory of the vast user is not in `/var/lib/vast`.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#2734](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2734).

#### Clear failed partitions from the cache

[Section titled “Clear failed partitions from the cache”](#clear-failed-partitions-from-the-cache)

VAST now ejects partitions from the LRU cache if they fail to load with an I/O error.
