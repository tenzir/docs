Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/releases/tag/2020.06.25).

### Features

[Section titled “Features”](#features)

#### Allow output format selection for the pivot/explore command

[Section titled “Allow output format selection for the pivot/explore command”](#allow-output-format-selection-for-the-pivotexplore-command)

The output format for the `explore` and `pivot` commands can now be set using the `explore.format` and `pivot.format` options respectively. Both default to JSON.

#### Support type relaxation for JSON import

[Section titled “Support type relaxation for JSON import”](#support-type-relaxation-for-json-import)

The `import json` command’s type restrictions are more relaxed now, and can additionally convert from JSON strings to VAST internal data types.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#891](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/891).

#### Support /etc/vast/vast.conf as global config

[Section titled “Support /etc/vast/vast.conf as global config”](#support-etcvastvastconf-as-global-config)

VAST now supports `/etc/vast/vast.conf` as an additional fallback for the configuration file. The following file locations are looked at in order: Path specified on the command line via `--config=path/to/vast.conf`, `vast.conf` in current working directory, `${INSTALL_PREFIX}/etc/vast/vast.conf`, and `/etc/vast/vast.conf`.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#898](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/898).

#### Support aging out data based on a query

[Section titled “Support aging out data based on a query”](#support-aging-out-data-based-on-a-query)

VAST now supports aging out existing data. This feature currently only concerns data in the archive. The options `system.aging-frequency` and `system.aging-query` configure a query that runs on a regular schedule to determine which events to delete. It is also possible to trigger an aging cycle manually.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#929](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/929).

#### Add limit options for vast explore

[Section titled “Add limit options for vast explore”](#add-limit-options-for-vast-explore)

VAST now has options to limit the amount of results produced by an invocation of `vast explore`.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#882](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/882).

#### Forcefully emit batches on input timeout error

[Section titled “Forcefully emit batches on input timeout error”](#forcefully-emit-batches-on-input-timeout-error)

The `import` command gained a new `--read-timeout` option that forces data to be forwarded to the importer regardless of the internal batching parameters and table slices being unfinished. This allows for reducing the latency between the `import` command and the node. The default timeout is 10 seconds.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#916](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/916).

#### Add Bloom filter meta index

[Section titled “Add Bloom filter meta index”](#add-bloom-filter-meta-index)

The meta index now uses Bloom filters for equality queries involving IP addresses. This especially accelerates queries where the user wants to know whether a certain IP address exists in the entire database.

### Changes

[Section titled “Changes”](#changes)

#### Rename the ‘default’ table slice type to ‘caf’

[Section titled “Rename the ‘default’ table slice type to ‘caf’”](#rename-the-default-table-slice-type-to-caf)

The `default` table slice type has been renamed to `caf`. It has not been the default when built with Apache Arrow support for a while now, and the new name more accurately reflects what it is doing.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#948](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/948).

#### Print timestamps with full precision for JSON

[Section titled “Print timestamps with full precision for JSON”](#print-timestamps-with-full-precision-for-json)

The JSON export format now renders timestamps using strings instead of numbers in order to avoid possible loss of precision.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#909](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/909).

#### PRs 908-951

[Section titled “PRs 908-951”](#prs-908-951)

The options `system.table-slice-type` and `system.table-slice-size` have been removed, as they duplicated `import.table-slice-type` and `import.table-slice-size` respectively.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#908](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/908).

### Bug Fixes

[Section titled “Bug Fixes”](#bug-fixes)

#### Improve handling of UTF-8 input

[Section titled “Improve handling of UTF-8 input”](#improve-handling-of-utf-8-input)

The `export json` command now correctly unescapes its output.

VAST now correctly checks for control characters in inputs.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#910](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/910).

#### Simplify id space management

[Section titled “Simplify id space management”](#simplify-id-space-management)

A bogus import process that assembled table slices with a greater number of events than expected by the node was able to lead to wrong query results.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#908](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/908).

#### Fix use-after-free bug in indexer state

[Section titled “Fix use-after-free bug in indexer state”](#fix-use-after-free-bug-in-indexer-state)

A use after free bug would sometimes crash the node while it was shutting down.
