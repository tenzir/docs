### Bug Fixes

[Section titled “Bug Fixes”](#bug-fixes)

#### Assertion failures in `to_google_secops`

[Section titled “Assertion failures in to\_google\_secops”](#assertion-failures-in-to_google_secops)

The `to_google_secops` operator failed assertions when a batch of data was missing `log_type` or if no input was received for longer than `batch_timeout`.

#### Fixed handling of `time` in `to_amazon_security_lake`

[Section titled “Fixed handling of time in to\_amazon\_security\_lake”](#fixed-handling-of-time-in-to_amazon_security_lake)

Previously events with a `null` value for the OCSF `time` field would incorrectly be written to some partition in the lake. In rare circumstances, this could also cause a crash.

The operator now correctly skips events without a valid `time`.
