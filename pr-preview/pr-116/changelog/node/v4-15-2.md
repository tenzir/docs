#### Do not persist pipeline state updates on node shutdown

[Section titled “Do not persist pipeline state updates on node shutdown”](#do-not-persist-pipeline-state-updates-on-node-shutdown)

Some *Running* pipelines were considered *Completed* when the node shut down, causing them not to start up again automatically when the node restarted. Now, the node only considers pipelines *Completed* that entered the state on their own before the node’s shutdown.
