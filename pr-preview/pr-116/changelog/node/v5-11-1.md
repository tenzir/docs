#### `to_azure_log_analytics` compression

[Section titled “to\_azure\_log\_analytics compression”](#to_azure_log_analytics-compression)

The `to_azure_log_analytics` operator now compresses the sent payload, significantly reducing the bandwidth consumed.

### Bug Fixes

[Section titled “Bug Fixes”](#bug-fixes)

#### Fixed `from_http` default port

[Section titled “Fixed from\_http default port”](#fixed-from_http-default-port)

Using the `from_http` operator as a client without explicitly specifying a port resulted in an error complaining that the port cannot be zero. This now works as expected, meaning that the default port is derived correctly from the URL scheme, i.e., 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS.
