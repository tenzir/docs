# Tenzir Node v4.29.0

Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/releases/tag/v4.29.0).

### Features

[Section titled “Features”](#features)

#### Implement sub-duration functions

[Section titled “Implement sub-duration functions”](#implement-sub-duration-functions)

New functions `years`, `months`, `weeks`, `days`, `hours`, `minutes`, `seconds`, `milliseconds`, `microseconds` and `nanoseconds` convert a numeric value to the equivalent duration. Their counterpart `count_*` functions calculate how many units can the duration be broken into, i.e. `duration / unit`.

The `abs` function calculates the absolute value for a number or a duration.

#### Implement `base` option for `int()` and `uint()`

[Section titled “Implement base option for int() and uint()”](#implement-base-option-for-int-and-uint)

The new `base` option for `int` and `uint` functions allows parsing hexadecimal numbers in strings.

By [@raxyte](https://github.com/raxyte) in [#5006](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5006).

#### Implement some `print_*` functions

[Section titled “Implement some print\_\* functions”](#implement-some-print_-functions)

The `write_xsv` family of operators now accepts multi-character separators, instead of being restricted to a single character.

We added the `write_kv` operator, allowing you to write events as Key-Value pairs.

We added the functions `any.print_json()` and `any.print_yaml()` to print any value as a JSON or YAML string.

We added the functions `record.print_kv()`, `record.print_csv()`, `record.print_ssv()`, `record.print_tsv()` and `record.print_xsv()` to print records as the respective format.

### Changes

[Section titled “Changes”](#changes)

#### Compact NDJSON output

[Section titled “Compact NDJSON output”](#compact-ndjson-output)

The output of `write_ndjson` is now more compact and no longer includes unnecessary whitespace. Additionally, `write_json` no longer prints a trailing whitespace after each comma.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#5015](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5015).

#### Allow values to be `null` when charting

[Section titled “Allow values to be null when charting”](#allow-values-to-be-null-when-charting)

The `chart_area`, `chart_bar`, and `chart_pie` operators no longer reject null-values. Previously, gaps in charts were only supported for `chart_line`.

By [@raxyte](https://github.com/raxyte) in [#5009](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5009).

#### Implement some `print_*` functions

[Section titled “Implement some print\_\* functions”](#implement-some-print_-functions-1)

The `sep` argument on the `flatten` and `unflatten` functions is now a positional argument, allowing you to simply write `record.flatten("-")`.

The `unflatten` option found on many `read_*` operators and `parse_*` functions is now called `unflatten_separator`.

The `field_sep`, `list_sep` and `null_value` options on the XSV operators and functions (such as `read_xsv`, `write_csv` or `parse_tsv`) are now named arguments on all of them and are called `field_separator`, `list_separator` and `null_value`.

The `field_split` and `list_split` arguments for the `read_kv` operator and `parse_kv` function are now named arguments.

### Bug Fixes

[Section titled “Bug Fixes”](#bug-fixes)

#### Add to\_splunk to the ce binary packages

[Section titled “Add to\_splunk to the ce binary packages”](#add-to_splunk-to-the-ce-binary-packages)

We now include the `to_splunk` operator in the Tenzir binary packages.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#5012](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5012).

#### Normalize pushed-up predicates in `subscribe`

[Section titled “Normalize pushed-up predicates in subscribe”](#normalize-pushed-up-predicates-in-subscribe)

We fixed an optimization bug that caused pipelines of the form `subscribe <topic> | where <value> in <field>` to evaluate the predicate `<field> in <value>` instead, returning incorrect results from the pipeline.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#5014](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5014).

#### Respect `--color` option in default implicit events sink

[Section titled “Respect --color option in default implicit events sink”](#respect---color-option-in-default-implicit-events-sink)

The implicit events sink of the `tenzir` binary now respects the `--color=[always|never|auto]` option and the `NO_COLOR` environment variable. Previously, color usage was only determined based on whether `stdout` had a TTY attached.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#5007](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5007).

#### Fix a crash in `{parse,read}_grok` for invalid patterns

[Section titled “Fix a crash in {parse,read}\_grok for invalid patterns”](#fix-a-crash-in-parseread_grok-for-invalid-patterns)

The `read_grok` operator and `parse_grok` functions no longer crash when providing an invalid Grok expression.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#5018](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5018).

#### Fix compilation error handling inside `if`

[Section titled “Fix compilation error handling inside if”](#fix-compilation-error-handling-inside-if)

A compilation error within an `if` statement no longer causes pipelines to crash.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#5011](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5011).

#### Remove type layering

[Section titled “Remove type layering”](#remove-type-layering)

We fixed a bug that caused `type_id(this)` to return inconsistent values for schemas with metadata attached, e.g., after assigning a schema name via `@name = "new_name"` or using operators like `chart_line` that add custom metadata to a schema for use of the Tenzir Platform. Unfortunately, this may cause charts or tables added to dashboards before Tenzir Platform v1.7 to break. To fix them, click on the action menu on the chart or table on the dashboard, click “Open in Explorer,” and re-add the chart or table to the dashboard. We are sorry about this inconvenience.
