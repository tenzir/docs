### Features

[Section titled “Features”](#features)

#### Implement `strict { ... }`

[Section titled “Implement strict { ... }”](#implement-strict--)

We added a new `strict` operator that takes a pipeline and treats all warnings emitted by that pipeline as errors, i.e., effectively stopping the pipeline at the first diagnostic. This is useful when you to ensure want a critical piece of your pipeline does not continue in unexpected scenarios.

#### Add `encode_url` and `decode_url` functions

[Section titled “Add encode\_url and decode\_url functions”](#add-encode_url-and-decode_url-functions)

The `encode_url` and `decode_url` functions encode and decode URLs. For example, `"Hello%20World".decode_url()` returns `b"Hello World"`.

### Changes

[Section titled “Changes”](#changes)

#### Remove `pipeline::internal_parse()` from `to_azure_log_analytics`

[Section titled “Remove pipeline::internal\_parse() from to\_azure\_log\_analytics”](#remove-pipelineinternal_parse-from-to_azure_log_analytics)

The `table` option of the `to_azure_log_analytics` has been renamed to `stream` to better reflect the expected value. Additionally, a new option `batch_timeout` has been added to configure the max duration to wait before finishing a batch.

### Bug Fixes

[Section titled “Bug Fixes”](#bug-fixes)

#### Fix user-defined operators for TQL2

[Section titled “Fix user-defined operators for TQL2”](#fix-user-defined-operators-for-tql2)

User-defined operators still required the `// tql2` comment at the start or the `tenzir.tql2` option to be set, despite TQL2 being the default since Tenzir Node v5.0. They now work as expected.
