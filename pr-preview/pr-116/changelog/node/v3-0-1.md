### Features

[Section titled “Features”](#features)

#### Allow `/* ... */` comments in the VAST language

[Section titled “Allow /\* ... \*/ comments in the VAST language”](#allow----comments-in-the-vast-language)

The VAST language now supports comments using the familiar `/* comment */` notation. This makes it easy to document multi-line pipelines inline.

### Bug Fixes

#### Include outdated but not undersized partitions in automatic rebuilds

[Section titled “Include outdated but not undersized partitions in automatic rebuilds”](#include-outdated-but-not-undersized-partitions-in-automatic-rebuilds)

Automatic partition rebuilding both updates partitions with an outdated storage format and merges undersized partitions continuously in the background. This now also works as expected for outdated but not undersized partitions.

#### Avoid crashing when reading a pre-2.0 partition

[Section titled “Avoid crashing when reading a pre-2.0 partition”](#avoid-crashing-when-reading-a-pre-20-partition)

VAST no longer crashes when reading an unsupported partition from VAST v1.x. Instead, the partition is ignored correctly. Since v2.2 VAST automatically rebuilds partitions in the background to ensure compatibility.
