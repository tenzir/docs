# VAST 2021.09.30

Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/releases/tag/2021.09.30).

### Features

[Section titled “Features”](#features)

#### Let empty queries export everything

[Section titled “Let empty queries export everything”](#let-empty-queries-export-everything)

The query argument to the export and count commands may now be omitted, which causes the commands to operate on all data. Note that this may be a very expensive operation, so use with caution.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1879](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1879).

#### Add Zeek writer plugin

[Section titled “Add Zeek writer plugin”](#add-zeek-writer-plugin)

The `broker` plugin is now a also *writer* plugin on top of being already a *reader* plugin. The new plugin enables exporting query results directly into a a Zeek process, e.g., to write Zeek scripts that incorporate context from the past. Run `vast export broker <expr>` to ship events via Broker that Zeek dispatches under the event `VAST::data(layout: string, data: any)`.

#### Add the streaming and query info to the index status

[Section titled “Add the streaming and query info to the index status”](#add-the-streaming-and-query-info-to-the-index-status)

The output of `vast status --detailed` now contains information about queries that are currently processed in the index.

#### Add tool to regenerate .mdx files

[Section titled “Add tool to regenerate .mdx files”](#add-tool-to-regenerate-mdx-files)

The new tool `mdx-regenerate` allows operators to re-create all `.mdx` files in a database directory to the latest file format version while VAST is running. This is useful for advanced users in preparation for version upgrades that bump the format version.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#1866](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1866).

#### Bundle an example configuration file with plugins

[Section titled “Bundle an example configuration file with plugins”](#bundle-an-example-configuration-file-with-plugins)

If present in the plugin source directory, the build scaffolding now automatically installs `<plugin>.yaml.example` files, commenting out every line so the file has no effect. This serves as documentation for operators that can modify the installed file in-place.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1860](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1860).

#### Show loaded config files in status output

[Section titled “Show loaded config files in status output”](#show-loaded-config-files-in-status-output)

Running `vat status --detailed` now lists all loaded configuration files under `system.config-files`.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1871](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1871).

### Changes

[Section titled “Changes”](#changes)

#### Make partition-local stores the default

[Section titled “Make partition-local stores the default”](#make-partition-local-stores-the-default)

The default store backend now is `segment-store` in order to enable the use of partition transforms in the future. To continue using the (now deprecated) legacy store backend, set `vast.store-backend` to archive.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#1876](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1876).

#### Install example configuration files to datarootdir

[Section titled “Install example configuration files to datarootdir”](#install-example-configuration-files-to-datarootdir)

Example configuration files are now installed to the datarootdir as opposed to the sysconfdir in order to avoid overriding previously installed configuration files.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1880](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1880).

### Bug Fixes

[Section titled “Bug Fixes”](#bug-fixes)

#### Fix possible garbage in status command output

[Section titled “Fix possible garbage in status command output”](#fix-possible-garbage-in-status-command-output)

The status command no longer occasionally contains garbage keys when the VAST server is under high load.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1872](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1872).

#### Fix response promises for disk monitor deletion

[Section titled “Fix response promises for disk monitor deletion”](#fix-response-promises-for-disk-monitor-deletion)

The disk monitor no longer fails to delete segments of particularly busy partitions with the `segment-store` store backend.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1892](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1892).

#### Tailor expressions in filter operation

[Section titled “Tailor expressions in filter operation”](#tailor-expressions-in-filter-operation)

Import filter expressions now work correctly with queries using field extractors, e.g., `vast import suricata 'event_type == "alert"' < path/to/eve.json`.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1885](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1885).

#### Disallow unsupported field meta extractor predicates

[Section titled “Disallow unsupported field meta extractor predicates”](#disallow-unsupported-field-meta-extractor-predicates)

Expression predicates of the `#field` type now produce error messages instead of empty result sets for operations that are not supported.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#1886](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1886).

#### Fix possible desync in pending queries map

[Section titled “Fix possible desync in pending queries map”](#fix-possible-desync-in-pending-queries-map)

The index now correctly cancels pending queries when the requester dies.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1884](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1884).

#### Fix ignoring of remote sources and sinks for status

[Section titled “Fix ignoring of remote sources and sinks for status”](#fix-ignoring-of-remote-sources-and-sinks-for-status)

Remote sources and sinks are no longer erroneously included in the output of VAST status.
