# Talking HTTP

This release brings forth improvements to HTTP support in Tenzir, supporting requests as transformations and paginating APIs.

Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/releases/tag/v5.3.0).

### Features

[Section titled “Features”](#features)

#### Implement `http` operator

[Section titled “Implement http operator”](#implement-http-operator)

We implemented the `http` operator that allows making HTTP/1.1 requests to a URL. The operator also allows paginate APIs based on the responses.

#### Introduce lambda functions

[Section titled “Introduce lambda functions”](#introduce-lambda-functions)

TQL now supports lambda expressions. They are supported in the `where` and `map` functions on list, and on the newly added `count_if` aggregation function. Instead of `[1, 2, 3].map(x, x + 1)`, use `[1, 2, 3].map(x => x + 1)`. This subtle change makes it obvious that the expression is not evaluated on the entire list, but rather on each element individually.

The `count_if` aggregation function counts the number of elements in a list that satisfy a given predicate. For example, `[1, 2, 3].count_if(x => x > 1)` returns `2`.

#### Implement `from_http` client

[Section titled “Implement from\_http client”](#implement-from_http-client)

The `from_http` operator now supports HTTP client functionality. This allows sending HTTP/1.1 requests, including support for custom methods, headers, payloads, pagination, retries, and connection timeouts. The operator can be used to fetch data from HTTP APIs and ingest it directly into pipelines.

Make a simple GET request auto-selecting the parser:

```tql
from_http "https://api.example.com/data"
```

Post data to some API:

```tql
from_http "https://api.example.com/submit", payload={foo: "bar"}.print_json(),
          headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"}
```

Paginating APIs:

```tql
from_http "https://api.example.com/items",
          paginate=(x => x.next_url if x.has_more? == true)
```

### Changes

[Section titled “Changes”](#changes)

#### `load_http` deprecated

[Section titled “load\_http deprecated”](#load_http-deprecated)

The `from` operator now dispatches to `from_http` for `http[s]` URLs.

The `load_http` operator is now deprecated in favor of `from_http`.

#### Fix overflow warning for `-9223372036854775808`

[Section titled “Fix overflow warning for -9223372036854775808”](#fix-overflow-warning-for--9223372036854775808)

The lowest 64-bit integer, `-9223372036854775808`, no longer causes an overflow warning.

#### Fix a crash in `to_clickhouse`

[Section titled “Fix a crash in to\_clickhouse”](#fix-a-crash-in-to_clickhouse)

We fixed an issue when trying to send lists in `to_clickhouse` that would cause the ClickHouse server to drop the connection.

#### Fix evaluation of `null if true else …`

[Section titled “Fix evaluation of null if true else …”](#fix-evaluation-of-null-if-true-else)

The expression `null if true else 42` previously returned `42`. It now correctly returns `null`.
