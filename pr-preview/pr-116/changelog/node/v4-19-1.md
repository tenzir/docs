#### Explicitly handle AMQP heartbeats in saver

[Section titled “Explicitly handle AMQP heartbeats in saver”](#explicitly-handle-amqp-heartbeats-in-saver)

Activating heartbeats via `-X`/`--set` on an `amqp` saver triggered socket errors if the interval between sent messages was larger than the heartbeat interval. This has been fixed by handling heartbeat communication correctly in such cases.
