# Dynamic Publish

The operator now supports event-dependent topics, making routing between pipelines more flexible. Additionally, new and operators make taking apart custom logs easier than before.

Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/releases/tag/v5.6.0).

### Features

[Section titled “Features”](#features)

#### `read_delimited` and `read_delimited_regex`

[Section titled “read\_delimited and read\_delimited\_regex”](#read_delimited-and-read_delimited_regex)

TQL now supports two new operators for parsing data streams with custom delimiters: `read_delimited` and `read_delimited_regex`. These operators provide a more intuitive and discoverable way to split data on custom separators compared to the deprecated `split_at_regex` option in `read_lines`.

The `read_delimited` operator splits input on exact string or blob matches:

```tql
load_file "data.txt"
read_delimited "||"
```

The `read_delimited_regex` operator splits input using regular expression patterns:

```tql
load_tcp "0.0.0.0:514" {
  read_delimited_regex "(?=<[0-9]+>)"
}
```

Both operators support binary data processing and optionally including the separator in the output. The `split_at_regex` option in `read_lines` is now deprecated in favor of these dedicated operators.

#### Publishing to dynamic topics

[Section titled “Publishing to dynamic topics”](#publishing-to-dynamic-topics)

The `publish` operator now allows for dynamic topics to be derived from each individual event.

For example, assuming Suricata logs, `publish f"suricata.{event_type}"` now publishes to the topic `suricata.alert` for alert events and `suricata.flow` for flow events. This works with any expression that evaluates to a string, including `publish @name` to use the schema name of the event.

#### HTTP request metadata

[Section titled “HTTP request metadata”](#http-request-metadata)

The `from_http` operator now supports the `metadata_field` option when using the server mode and not just client mode. The request metadata has the following schema:

| Field      | Type     | Description                          |
| :--------- | :------- | :----------------------------------- |
| `headers`  | `record` | The request headers.                 |
| `query`    | `record` | The query parameters of the request. |
| `path`     | `string` | The path requested.                  |
| `fragment` | `string` | The URI fragment of the request.     |
| `method`   | `string` | The HTTP method of the request.      |
| `version`  | `string` | The HTTP version of the request.     |

### Bug Fixes

[Section titled “Bug Fixes”](#bug-fixes)

#### OCSF `-dev` versions

[Section titled “OCSF -dev versions”](#ocsf--dev-versions)

The `ocsf::apply` operator can now be used with the newest development version of OCSF (v1.6.0-dev). Previously, it claimed that this version does not exist.

#### Fixed panic in `write_parquet`

[Section titled “Fixed panic in write\_parquet”](#fixed-panic-in-write_parquet)

The `write_parquet` operator no longer panics when specifying `compression_type="snappy"` without a `compression_level`.
