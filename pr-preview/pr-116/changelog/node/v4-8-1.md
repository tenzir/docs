#### Support setting profiles in the Velociraptor config

[Section titled “Support setting profiles in the Velociraptor config”](#support-setting-profiles-in-the-velociraptor-config)

The `velociraptor` operator gained a new `--profile <profile>` option to support multiple configured Velociraptor instances. To opt into using profiles, move your Velociraptor configuration in `<configdir>/tenzir/plugin/velociraptor.yaml` from `<config>` to `profiles.<profile>.<config>`.

### Bug Fixes

#### Enable the AMQP plugin in the static binary

[Section titled “Enable the AMQP plugin in the static binary”](#enable-the-amqp-plugin-in-the-static-binary)

The `amqp` connector plugin was incorrectly packaged and unavailable in some build configurations. The plugin is now available in all builds.

Failing to create the virtualenv of the `python` operator caused subsequent uses of the `python` operator to silently fail. This no longer happens.

The Debian package now depends on `python3-venv`, which is required for the `python` operator to create its virtualenv.
