# VAST 2021.06.24

Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/releases/tag/2021.06.24).

### Features

[Section titled “Features”](#features)

#### Add support for per-plugin configuration files

[Section titled “Add support for per-plugin configuration files”](#add-support-for-per-plugin-configuration-files)

Plugins load their respective configuration from `<configdir>/vast/plugin/<plugin-name>.yaml` in addition to the regular configuration file at `<configdir>/vast/vast.yaml`. The new plugin-specific file does not require putting configuration under the key `plugins.<plugin-name>`. This allows for deploying plugins without needing to touch the `<configdir>/vast/vast.yaml` configuration file.

#### Optionally read environment variable for VAST endpoint

[Section titled “Optionally read environment variable for VAST endpoint”](#optionally-read-environment-variable-for-vast-endpoint)

It’s now possible to configure the VAST endpoint as an environment variable by setting `VAST_ENDPOINT`. This has higher precedence than setting `vast.endpoint` in configuration files, but lower precedence than passing `--endpoint=` on the command-line.

By [@rolandpeelen](https://github.com/rolandpeelen) in [#1714](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1714).

#### Rework the plugin loading logic

[Section titled “Rework the plugin loading logic”](#rework-the-plugin-loading-logic)

The options `vast.plugins` and `vast.plugin-dirs` may now be specified on the command line as well as the configuration. Use the options `--plugins` and `--plugin-dirs` respectively.

Add the reserved plugin name `bundled` to `vast.plugins` to enable load all bundled plugins, i.e., static or dynamic plugins built alongside VAST, or use `--plugins=bundled` on the command line. The reserved plugin name `all` causes all bundled and external plugins to be loaded, i.e., all shared libraries matching `libvast-plugin-*` from the configured `vast.plugin-dirs`.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1703](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1703).

#### Add option for configurable post-start hooks

[Section titled “Add option for configurable post-start hooks”](#add-option-for-configurable-post-start-hooks)

The new option `vast.start.commands` allows for specifying an ordered list of VAST commands that run after successful startup. The effect is the same as first starting a node, and then using another VAST client to issue commands. This is useful for commands that have side effects that cannot be expressed through the config file, e.g., starting a source inside the VAST server that listens on a socket or reads packets from a network interface.

### Changes

[Section titled “Changes”](#changes)

#### Rework the plugin loading logic

[Section titled “Rework the plugin loading logic”](#rework-the-plugin-loading-logic-1)

VAST no longer loads static plugins by default. Generally, VAST now treats static plugins and bundled dynamic plugins equally, allowing users to enable or disable static plugins as needed for their deployments.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1703](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1703).

#### PRs 1721-1734

[Section titled “PRs 1721-1734”](#prs-1721-1734)

VAST merges lists from configuration files. E.g., running VAST with `--plugins=some-plugin` and `vast.plugins: [other-plugin]` in the configuration now results in both `some-plugin` and `other-plugin` being loaded (sorted by the usual precedence), instead of just `some-plugin`.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1721](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1721).

#### Change chat from Gitter to Slack

[Section titled “Change chat from Gitter to Slack”](#change-chat-from-gitter-to-slack)

The VAST community chat moved from Gitter to Slack. [Join us](http://slack.tenzir.com) in the `#vast` channel for vibrant discussions.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#1696](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1696).

#### Remove support for building without Arrow

[Section titled “Remove support for building without Arrow”](#remove-support-for-building-without-arrow)

Apache Arrow is now a required dependency. The previously deprecated build option `-DVAST_ENABLE_ARROW=OFF` no longer exists.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1683](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1683).

#### Fixup repository-internal symlinks in Dockerfile

[Section titled “Fixup repository-internal symlinks in Dockerfile”](#fixup-repository-internal-symlinks-in-dockerfile)

The [tenzir/vast](https://hub.docker.com/r/tenzir/vast) Docker image bundles the PCAP plugin.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1705](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1705).

### Bug Fixes

[Section titled “Bug Fixes”](#bug-fixes)

#### Fix log rotation threshold option

[Section titled “Fix log rotation threshold option”](#fix-log-rotation-threshold-option)

The `vast.log-rotation-threshold` option was silently ignored, causing VAST to always use the default log rotation threshold of 10 MiB. The option works as expected now.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1709](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1709).

#### Fix a bunch of smaller issues

[Section titled “Fix a bunch of smaller issues”](#fix-a-bunch-of-smaller-issues)

Building plugins against an installed VAST no longer requires manually specifying `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON`. The option is now correctly enabled by default for external plugins.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1697](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1697).

#### Remove dead condition and fix Docker release tags

[Section titled “Remove dead condition and fix Docker release tags”](#remove-dead-condition-and-fix-docker-release-tags)

Additional tags for the [tenzir/vast](https://hub.docker.com/r/tenzir/vast) Docker image for the release versions exist, e.g., `tenzir/vast:2021.05.27`.

By [@0snap](https://github.com/0snap) in [#1711](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1711).

#### Fix shutdown hang in sources on SIGTERM/SIGINT

[Section titled “Fix shutdown hang in sources on SIGTERM/SIGINT”](#fix-shutdown-hang-in-sources-on-sigtermsigint)

Import processes no longer hang on receiving SIGINT or SIGKILL. Instead, they shut down properly after flushing yet to be processed data.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1718](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1718).

#### Make unix dgram metrics sink connectionless

[Section titled “Make unix dgram metrics sink connectionless”](#make-unix-dgram-metrics-sink-connectionless)

The UDS metrics sink continues to send data when the receiving socket is recreated.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#1702](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1702).

#### Handle arbitrary types in bloom filter synopsis

[Section titled “Handle arbitrary types in bloom filter synopsis”](#handle-arbitrary-types-in-bloom-filter-synopsis)

VAST no longer crashes when querying for string fields with non-string values. Instead, an error message warns the user about an invalid query.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#1685](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1685).

#### Handle quoted strings in CSV parser

[Section titled “Handle quoted strings in CSV parser”](#handle-quoted-strings-in-csv-parser)

The `import csv` command handles quoted fields correctly. Previously, the quotes were part of the parsed value, and field separators in quoted strings caused the parser to fail.
