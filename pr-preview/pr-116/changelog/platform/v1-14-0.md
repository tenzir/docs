# Platform Secrets

This release adds CLI support for adding, removing and updating secrets. It also adds a new three-dot menu on the pipelines page, as well as partial pipeline execution from the history.

Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/platform/releases/tag/v1.14.0).

### Features

[Section titled “Features”](#features)

#### Three-dot menu for pipeline items

[Section titled “Three-dot menu for pipeline items”](#three-dot-menu-for-pipeline-items)

You can now quickly start, stop, copy the ID, or delete a pipeline right from the pipelines table. Just click the three-dot menu at the far right of any pipeline row. It’s a simple way to manage one pipeline at a time, without needing to open the bulk actions menu.

#### Add secrets support for the Platform

[Section titled “Add secrets support for the Platform”](#add-secrets-support-for-the-platform)

With this release, the Tenzir Platform now supports storing secrets on a per-workspace level.

In the Tenzir UI, you can click on the new gears icon in the workspace switcher to get to the Workspace settings, where you can add, modify or delete secrets for you workspace.

In the Tenzir CLI, you can use the new `tenzir-platform secret` subcommand for the same purpose:

```plain
tenzir-platform secret add <name> [--file=<file>] [--value=<value>] [--env]
tenzir-platform secret update <secret> [--file=<file>] [--value=<value>] [--env]
tenzir-platform secret delete <secret>
tenzir-platform secret list [--json]
```

#### Support using different blob storage URLs for UI and Nodes

[Section titled “Support using different blob storage URLs for UI and Nodes”](#support-using-different-blob-storage-urls-for-ui-and-nodes)

The Tenzir Platform now supports the `BLOB_STORAGE__NODES_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT_URL` environment variable that allows overriding the URL used by the nodes to reach the configured S3-compatible blob storage. This is useful if the Tenzir Nodes run in a separate network from the Tenzir UI, and the blob storage is exposed under different domains in both networks.

#### Partial pipeline execution

[Section titled “Partial pipeline execution”](#partial-pipeline-execution)

You can now run a selected portion of the pipeline by highlighting it with your mouse or keyboard. When a selection is active, the **Run** button changes to **Run selected**, allowing you to execute just the highlighted section for quicker iteration and testing.

#### Secret data type display

[Section titled “Secret data type display”](#secret-data-type-display)

Secret data types now display as `<secret>` in the platform, for example, in the explorer table. A tooltip explains that secret values are not transported to the platform for security reasons.

In TQL exports (such as copy to clipboard), secrets are copied as `null`.

### Changes

[Section titled “Changes”](#changes)

#### Make the list of nodes reload more often again

[Section titled “Make the list of nodes reload more often again”](#make-the-list-of-nodes-reload-more-often-again)

We recently raised the refresh time on the list of nodes to 30 seconds. After your feedback, it became apparent that we should have kept it as it was.

#### Better error messages for HTTP errors

[Section titled “Better error messages for HTTP errors”](#better-error-messages-for-http-errors)

The Tenzir Platform CLI now prints better error messages for HTTP errors encountered when communicating with the Tenzir Platform, including the contents of the `detail` field if provided.

#### Chronological diagnostics sorting in the explorer

[Section titled “Chronological diagnostics sorting in the explorer”](#chronological-diagnostics-sorting-in-the-explorer)

Diagnostics listed next to the editor are now sorted chronologically, making it easier to follow the order in which issues occur.

### Bug Fixes

[Section titled “Bug Fixes”](#bug-fixes)

#### Fix false ‘deployed pipeline failed’ toasts

[Section titled “Fix false ‘deployed pipeline failed’ toasts”](#fix-false-deployed-pipeline-failed-toasts)

We no longer show ‘deployed pipeline failed’ toasts for pipelines that weren’t actually deployed, but were running via the Explorer, Dashboard, or other sources like that.

#### Fix ‘View’-button in failed pipeline Toast

[Section titled “Fix ‘View’-button in failed pipeline Toast”](#fix-view-button-in-failed-pipeline-toast)

When a deployed pipeline fails, a “Toast” popup is shown in the bottom right that allows you to view the error, except, that button didn’t work. Now it does!

And while we were at it, we also improved the text for these toasts a little to make it clearer that it’s specifically about a *deployed* pipeline.

#### Correctly set workspace category when creating new workspaces

[Section titled “Correctly set workspace category when creating new workspaces”](#correctly-set-workspace-category-when-creating-new-workspaces)

The Tenzir Platform CLI now correctly sets the workspace category when creating a new workspace.
