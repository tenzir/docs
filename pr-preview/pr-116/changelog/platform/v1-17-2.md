# Improved History Pane Controls

You can now select parts of a pipeline from the history pane without closing it and the bottom bar in charts does not overlap with the contant any more.

#### Fixed history item clicks blocking text selection

[Section titled “Fixed history item clicks blocking text selection”](#fixed-history-item-clicks-blocking-text-selection)

Clicking a history item no longer adds its pipeline to the editor. That action now appears as a button in the floating controls on each item, so you can freely select and copy text without accidentally modifying the editor or closing the history pane.

We added extra space below charts to prevent them from overlapping with the floating controls bar in the Explorer.
