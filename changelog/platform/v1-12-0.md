#### Improved pipeline list activity metrics loading state

* The loading state for the sparkbars in the pipeline table no longer shows forever if none of the pipelines are running.
* The loading spinner for the sparkbars in the pipeline table has been replaced by a pulsating skeleton of the sparkbars, which is a little easier on the eyes.

#### Result controls moved to a floating bar

[Section titled “Result controls moved to a floating bar”](#result-controls-moved-to-a-floating-bar)

The result controls in the Explorer are now shown in a floating bar anchored at the bottom center of the page, instead of above the results table, for easier access and a cleaner layout.

#### Schemas pane on the right

[Section titled “Schemas pane on the right”](#schemas-pane-on-the-right)

The schemas pane in the Explorer is now docked at the right edge consistently, removing confusion between the icons for expanding schemas pane and the nodes pane, and putting more attention on the results table.

* The ingress/egress data shown now gets more realtime updates.
