# Explorer for Large Datasets

This release revamps the Explorer to better support large datasets.

Additionally, this release contains the following bug fixes and improvements:

* The *Add to Dashboard* button in the Explorer is no longer disabled when the corresponding history entry is removed.
* This release fixes a bug that prevents the *Save* button on dashboards from working. The save button now also shows a loading state when applicable.
* This release makes pie chart legends scrollable.
* All log scales in charts change to symlog scales, which handle zero and negative values more gracefully.
