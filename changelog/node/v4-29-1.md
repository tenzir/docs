### Bug Fixes

[Section titled “Bug Fixes”](#bug-fixes)

#### Make `drop` not remove empty records

[Section titled “Make drop not remove empty records”](#make-drop-not-remove-empty-records)

Dropping all fields from a record with the `drop` operator no longer removes the record itself. For example, `from {x: {y: 0}} | drop x.y` now returns `{x: {}}` instead of `{}`.

#### Fix crash in the MSB in merging mode

[Section titled “Fix crash in the MSB in merging mode”](#fix-crash-in-the-msb-in-merging-mode)

We fixed a bug in the `read_xsv` and `parse_xsv` family of operators and functions that caused the parser to fail unexpectedly when the data contained a list (as specified through the list separator) for fields where the provided `schema` did not expect lists.

#### Fix `tls` option of `to_splunk`

[Section titled “Fix tls option of to\_splunk”](#fix-tls-option-of-to_splunk)

Using the `tls` option of the `to_splunk` operator no longer directly emits an error.

#### Make UDO resolution order-independent

[Section titled “Make UDO resolution order-independent”](#make-udo-resolution-order-independent)

The resolution of user-defined operator aliases in the `tenzir.operators` section is no longer order-dependent. Previously, an operator `foo` may have depended on an operator `bar`, but not the other way around. This limitation no longer exists.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#5029](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5029).

#### Fix startup delay in `from_fluent_bit`

[Section titled “Fix startup delay in from\_fluent\_bit”](#fix-startup-delay-in-from_fluent_bit)

We fixed a bug that caused pipelines with `from_fluent_bit` to not report their startup successfully, causing errors when deploying pipelines starting with the operator through the Tenzir Platform.
