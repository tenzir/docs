# Tenzir Node v4.18.1

Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/releases/tag/v4.18.1).

### Features

[Section titled “Features”](#features)

#### Allow disabling node-to-node connections

[Section titled “Allow disabling node-to-node connections”](#allow-disabling-node-to-node-connections)

Setting the `tenzir.endpoint` option to `false` now causes the node not to listen for node-to-node connections. Previously, the port was always exposed for other nodes or `tenzir` processes to connect.

### Bug Fixes

[Section titled “Bug Fixes”](#bug-fixes)

#### Do not optimize `deduplicate`

[Section titled “Do not optimize deduplicate”](#do-not-optimize-deduplicate)

We fixed a bug that caused `deduplicate <fields...> --distance <distance>` to sometimes produce incorrect results when followed by `where <expr>` with an expression that filters on the deduplicated fields.

#### Don’t terminate `export` when used with `every`

[Section titled “Don’t terminate export when used with every”](#dont-terminate-export-when-used-with-every)

Pipelines that use the `every` modifier with the `export` operator no longer terminate after the first run.
