#### Incorrect values when charting

The charting operators did not update aggregations correctly, which resulted in out-of-sync or `null` values.

#### Fixed invalid JSON for small numbers

[Section titled “Fixed invalid JSON for small numbers”](#fixed-invalid-json-for-small-numbers)

Operators such as `write_json` previously emitted invalid JSON for small numbers. This also affected the Tenzir Platform as it invalidated some responses, which could lead to no data showing up in the Explorer.
