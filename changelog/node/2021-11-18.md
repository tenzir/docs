### Features

[Section titled “Features”](#features)

#### PRs 1929-1947

[Section titled “PRs 1929-1947”](#prs-1929-1947)

The export command now has a `--low-priority` option to reduce the priority of the request while query backlogs are being worked down.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#1929](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1929).

#### Partition transforms

[Section titled “Partition transforms”](#partition-transforms)

A new ‘apply’ handler in the index gives plugin authors the ability to apply transforms over entire partitions. Previously, transforms were limited to streams of table slice during import or export.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#1887](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1887).

#### Add metrics to the index

[Section titled “Add metrics to the index”](#add-metrics-to-the-index)

The keys `query.backlog.normal` and `query.backlog.low` have been added to the metrics output. The values indicate the number of quries that are currently in the backlog.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#1942](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1942).

### Changes

[Section titled “Changes”](#changes)

#### Introduce a query backlog in the index

[Section titled “Introduce a query backlog in the index”](#introduce-a-query-backlog-in-the-index)

The `max-queries` configuration option now works at a coarser granularity. It used to limit the number of queries that could simultaneously retrieve data, but it now sets the number of queries that can be processed at the same time.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#1896](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1896).

#### Update xxHash and hashing APIs

[Section titled “Update xxHash and hashing APIs”](#update-xxhash-and-hashing-apis)

VAST no longer vendors [xxHash](https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash), which is now a regular required dependency. Internally, VAST switched its default hash function to XXH3, providing a speedup of up to 3x.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#1905](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1905).

#### Bump minimum required CMake version to 3.18

[Section titled “Bump minimum required CMake version to 3.18”](#bump-minimum-required-cmake-version-to-318)

Building VAST from source now requires CMake 3.18+.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1914](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1914).

#### Prefer reading query from stdin if available

[Section titled “Prefer reading query from stdin if available”](#prefer-reading-query-from-stdin-if-available)

A recently added features allows for exporting everything when no query is provided. We’ve restricted this to prefer reading a query from stdin if available. Additionally, conflicting ways to read the query now trigger errors.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1917](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1917).

### Bug Fixes

[Section titled “Bug Fixes”](#bug-fixes)

#### Automatically add the skip attribute to records in lists

[Section titled “Automatically add the skip attribute to records in lists”](#automatically-add-the-skip-attribute-to-records-in-lists)

VAST no longer tries to create indexes for fields of type `list<record{...}>` as that wasn’t supported in the first place.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#1933](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1933).

#### Increase the partition erase timeout to 1 minute

[Section titled “Increase the partition erase timeout to 1 minute”](#increase-the-partition-erase-timeout-to-1-minute)

The timeout duration to delete partitions has been increased to one minute, reducing the frequency of warnings for hitting this timeout significantly.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#1897](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1897).

#### Change `suricata.dns` schema to match current DNS structure

[Section titled “Change suricata.dns schema to match current DNS structure”](#change-suricatadns-schema-to-match-current-dns-structure)

The `suricata.dns` schema has been updated to match the currently used EVE-JSON structure output by recent Suricata versions.

By [@satta](https://github.com/satta) in [#1919](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1919).

#### Load static plugins only when enabled

[Section titled “Load static plugins only when enabled”](#load-static-plugins-only-when-enabled)

Static plugins are no longer always loaded, but rather need to be explicitly enabled as documented. To restore the behavior from before this bug fix, set `vast.plugins: [bundled]` in your configuration file.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1959](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1959).

#### Update xxHash and hashing APIs

[Section titled “Update xxHash and hashing APIs”](#update-xxhash-and-hashing-apis-1)

When reading IPv6 addresses from PCAP data, only the first 4 bytes have been considered. VAST now stores all 16 bytes.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#1905](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1905).

#### Fix deletion of segments if CWD != dbdir

[Section titled “Fix deletion of segments if CWD != dbdir”](#fix-deletion-of-segments-if-cwd--dbdir)

Store files now get deleted correctly if the database directory differs from the working directory.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#1912](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1912).

#### Avoid references to record fields in fill\_status\_map

[Section titled “Avoid references to record fields in fill\_status\_map”](#avoid-references-to-record-fields-in-fill_status_map)

Debug builds of VAST no longer segfault on a status request with the `--debug` option.
