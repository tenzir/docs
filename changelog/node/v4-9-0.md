Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/releases/tag/v4.9.0).

### Features

[Section titled “Features”](#features)

#### Implement `context load`, `context save`, and `context reset`

[Section titled “Implement context load, context save, and context reset”](#implement-context-load-context-save-and-context-reset)

The `context reset` operator allows for clearing the state of a context.

The `context save` and `context load` operators allow serializing and deserializing the state of a context to/from bytes.

By [@eliaskosunen](https://github.com/eliaskosunen) in [#3908](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3908).

#### Add new ‘—file’ option to the python operator

[Section titled “Add new ‘—file’ option to the python operator”](#add-new-file-option-to-the-python-operator)

The `python` operator gained a new `--file` flag that allows loading python code from a file instead of providing it as part of the pipeline definition.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#3901](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3901).

#### Add Bloom filter context

[Section titled “Add Bloom filter context”](#add-bloom-filter-context)

The new `bloom-filter` context represents large sets in a space-efficient manner.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#3834](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3834).

#### Improve the `export` operator

[Section titled “Improve the export operator”](#improve-the-export-operator)

The `export` operator gained a `--low-priority` option, which causes it to interfere less with regular priority exports at the cost of potentially running slower.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3909](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3909).

#### Handle nested fields and integers as selectors in JSON parser

[Section titled “Handle nested fields and integers as selectors in JSON parser”](#handle-nested-fields-and-integers-as-selectors-in-json-parser)

The `--selector` option of the `json` parser now works with nested fields, and integer fields.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#3900](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3900).

#### Add `lines` printer

[Section titled “Add lines printer”](#add-lines-printer)

The `lines` printer enables simple line-delimited formatting of events.

By [@eliaskosunen](https://github.com/eliaskosunen) in [#3847](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3847).

#### Add the `openapi` operator

[Section titled “Add the openapi operator”](#add-the-openapi-operator)

The `openapi` source operator generates Tenzir’s OpenAPI specification. Use `openapi | to ./openapi.yaml` to generate a file with the canonical format.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3898](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3898).

#### Add structured\_data to syslog output

[Section titled “Add structured\_data to syslog output”](#add-structured_data-to-syslog-output)

The `structured_data` field in RFC 5424-style syslog messages is now parsed and included in the output.

By [@eliaskosunen](https://github.com/eliaskosunen) in [#3871](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3871).

#### Implement a context content dumping mechanism

[Section titled “Implement a context content dumping mechanism”](#implement-a-context-content-dumping-mechanism)

The new `context inspect <context-name>` command dumps a specific context’s user-provided data, usually the context’s content.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#3893](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3893).

#### Support parsing numeric timestamps since epoch

[Section titled “Support parsing numeric timestamps since epoch”](#support-parsing-numeric-timestamps-since-epoch)

When specifying a schema with a field typed as `time #unit=<unit>`, numeric values will be interpreted as offsets from the epoch.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#3927](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3927).

#### Add running and paused times to pipeline metrics

[Section titled “Add running and paused times to pipeline metrics”](#add-running-and-paused-times-to-pipeline-metrics)

Operator metrics now separately track the time that an operator was paused or running in the `time_paused` and `time_running` values in addition to the wall-clock time in `time_total`. Throughput rates now exclude the paused time from their calculation.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3940](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3940).

#### Rewrite `chart` and `set-attributes` operators

[Section titled “Rewrite chart and set-attributes operators”](#rewrite-chart-and-set-attributes-operators)

The `chart` operator adds metadata to the schema of the input events, enabling rendering events as bar, area, line, or pie charts on app.tenzir.com.

By [@eliaskosunen](https://github.com/eliaskosunen) in [#3866](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3866).

#### Update the main repository to include timestamped pipelines

[Section titled “Update the main repository to include timestamped pipelines”](#update-the-main-repository-to-include-timestamped-pipelines)

`show pipelines` and the `/pipeline` API endpoints now include `created_at` and `last_modified` fields that track the pipeline’s creation and last manual modification time, respectively. Pipelines created with older versions of Tenzir will use the start time of the node as their creation time.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#3869](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3869).

#### Implement more malleable lookup data for contexts

[Section titled “Implement more malleable lookup data for contexts”](#implement-more-malleable-lookup-data-for-contexts)

The context match events now contain a new field `mode` that states the lookup mode of this particular match.

The `enrich` operator gained a `--filter` option, which causes it to exclude enriched events that do not contain a context.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#3920](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3920).

#### Update the main repository to include the pipeline run ID

[Section titled “Update the main repository to include the pipeline run ID”](#update-the-main-repository-to-include-the-pipeline-run-id)

Managed pipelines now contain a new `total_runs` parameter that counts all started runs. The new `run` field is available in the events delivered by the `metrics` and `diagnostics` operators.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#3883](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3883).

### Changes

[Section titled “Changes”](#changes)

#### Context versioning

[Section titled “Context versioning”](#context-versioning)

The binary format used by contexts for saving on disk on node shutdown is now versioned. A node can support loading of multiple different versions, and automigrate between them.

By [@eliaskosunen](https://github.com/eliaskosunen) in [#3945](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3945).

#### Remove reader, writer, and language plugin types

[Section titled “Remove reader, writer, and language plugin types”](#remove-reader-writer-and-language-plugin-types)

We removed the `tenzir-ctl start` subcommand. Users should switch to the `tenzir-node` command instead, which accepts the same arguments and presents the same command-line interface.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3899](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3899).

#### Disable colors if `NO_COLOR` or not a terminal

[Section titled “Disable colors if NO\_COLOR or not a terminal”](#disable-colors-if-no_color-or-not-a-terminal)

Color escape codes are no longer emitted if `NO_COLOR` is set to a non-empty value, or when the output device is not a terminal.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#3952](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3952).

#### Allow plugins to bundle further builtins

[Section titled “Allow plugins to bundle further builtins”](#allow-plugins-to-bundle-further-builtins)

Plugins may now depend on other plugins. Plugins with unmet dependencies are automatically disabled. For example, the `lookup` and `enrich` plugins now depend on the `context` plugin. Run `show plugins` to see all available plugins and their dependencies.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3877](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3877).

#### Replace `tenzir.db-directory` with `tenzir.state-directory`

[Section titled “Replace tenzir.db-directory with tenzir.state-directory”](#replace-tenzirdb-directory-with-tenzirstate-directory)

The option `tenzir.db-directory` is deprecated in favor of the `tenzir.state-directory` option and will be removed in the future.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3889](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3889).

### Bug Fixes

[Section titled “Bug Fixes”](#bug-fixes)

#### Add support for commas in seconds in the time data parser

[Section titled “Add support for commas in seconds in the time data parser”](#add-support-for-commas-in-seconds-in-the-time-data-parser)

Commas are now allowed as subsecond separators in timestamps in TQL. Previously, only dots were allowed, but ISO 8601 allows for both.

By [@eliaskosunen](https://github.com/eliaskosunen) in [#3903](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3903).

#### Update the repository to include lookup lifetime fixes

[Section titled “Update the repository to include lookup lifetime fixes”](#update-the-repository-to-include-lookup-lifetime-fixes)

Retroactive lookups will now properly terminate when they have finished.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#3910](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3910).

#### Make `/serve` more consistent

[Section titled “Make /serve more consistent”](#make-serve-more-consistent)

The `/serve` API sometimes returned an empty string for the next continuation token instead of `null` when there are no further results to fetch. It now consistently returns `null`.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3885](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3885).

#### Prevent duplicate fields in schema

[Section titled “Prevent duplicate fields in schema”](#prevent-duplicate-fields-in-schema)

Invalid schema definitions, where a record contains the same key multiple times, are now detected and rejected.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#3929](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3929).

#### Gracefully handle misaligned header and values in `xsv` parser

[Section titled “Gracefully handle misaligned header and values in xsv parser”](#gracefully-handle-misaligned-header-and-values-in-xsv-parser)

The `xsv` parser (and by extension the `csv`, `tsv`, and `ssv` parsers) skipped lines that had a mismatch between the number of values contained and the number of fields defined in the header. Instead, it now fills in `null` values for missing values and, if the new `--auto-expand` option is set, also adds new header fields for excess values.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3874](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3874).

#### Fix restart on failure

[Section titled “Fix restart on failure”](#fix-restart-on-failure)

The option to automatically restart on failure did not correctly trigger for pipelines that failed an operator emitted an error diagnostic, a new mechanism for improved error messages introduced with Tenzir v4.8. Such pipelines now restart automatically as expected.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3947](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3947).

#### Fix logger deadlock in python tests

[Section titled “Fix logger deadlock in python tests”](#fix-logger-deadlock-in-python-tests)

We fixed a rare deadlock by changing the internal logger behavior from blocking until the oldest messages were consumed to overwriting them.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#3911](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3911).

#### Improve the `export` operator

[Section titled “Improve the export operator”](#improve-the-export-operator-1)

We fixed a bug that under rare circumstances led to an indefinite hang when using a high-volume source followed by a slow transformation and a fast sink.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3909](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3909).
