#### Properly recover corrupted partition data on startup

[Section titled “Properly recover corrupted partition data on startup”](#properly-recover-corrupted-partition-data-on-startup)

VAST now properly regenerates any corrupted, oversized partitions it encounters during startup, provided that the corresponding store files are available. These files could be produced by versions up to and including VAST v2.2, when using configurations with an increased maximum partition size.
