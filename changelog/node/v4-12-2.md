# Tenzir Node v4.12.2

Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/releases/tag/v4.12.2).

### Features

[Section titled “Features”](#features)

#### Add an operator for dumping schemas

[Section titled “Add an operator for dumping schemas”](#add-an-operator-for-dumping-schemas)

The chart operator now accepts the flags `--x-axis-type` and `--y-axis-type` for `bar`, `line`, and `area` charts, with the possible values being `log` and `linear`, with `linear` as the default value. Setting these flags defines the scale (logarithmic or linear) on the Tenzir App chart visualization.

### Bug Fixes

[Section titled “Bug Fixes”](#bug-fixes)

#### Use consistent attributes for y-axis in `chart`

[Section titled “Use consistent attributes for y-axis in chart”](#use-consistent-attributes-for-y-axis-in-chart)

The `chart` operator failed to render a chart when the y-axis was not specified explicitly and the events contained more than two top-level fields. This no longer happens.

#### Find syntax errors before record batch reading

[Section titled “Find syntax errors before record batch reading”](#find-syntax-errors-before-record-batch-reading)

The python operator now checks for syntax errors on operator start up.

#### Chain the execution node start response promise to the node lifetime

[Section titled “Chain the execution node start response promise to the node lifetime”](#chain-the-execution-node-start-response-promise-to-the-node-lifetime)

The retry delay now works for pipelines that fail during startup.

#### Restore implicit `read json` in `from tcp`

[Section titled “Restore implicit read json in from tcp”](#restore-implicit-read-json-in-from-tcp)

We accidentally removed the implicit `read json` from `from tcp` in Tenzir v4.12. The shortform now works as expected again.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4175](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4175).

#### Fix shutdown of `every <interval> <transformation|sink>`

[Section titled “Fix shutdown of every \<interval> \<transformation|sink>”](#fix-shutdown-of-every-interval-transformationsink)

Transformations or sinks used with the `every` operator modifier did not shut down correctly when exhausting their input. This now work as expected.
