# Tenzir Node v4.23.0

Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/releases/tag/v4.23.0).

### Features

[Section titled “Features”](#features)

#### Implement `in` for `list_type`

[Section titled “Implement in for list\_type”](#implement-in-for-list_type)

The relational operator `in` now supports checking for existence of an element in a list. For example, `where x in ["important", "values"]` is functionally equivalent to `where x == "important" or x == "values"`.

#### Add universal function call syntax

[Section titled “Add universal function call syntax”](#add-universal-function-call-syntax)

TQL now supports “universal function call syntax,” which means that every method is callable as a function and every function with at least one positional argument is callable as a method.

#### Implement `floor` and `ceil` functions

[Section titled “Implement floor and ceil functions”](#implement-floor-and-ceil-functions)

`ceil` and `floor` join the existing `round` function for rounding numbers, durations, and timestamps upwards and downwards, respectively.

#### Add spread syntax `...expr` for lists

[Section titled “Add spread syntax ...expr for lists”](#add-spread-syntax-expr-for-lists)

### Bug Fixes

[Section titled “Bug Fixes”](#bug-fixes)

#### Correctly handle duplicate serve requests and tune some logs

#### Fix TQL2 `summarize` with no groups and no input

[Section titled “Fix TQL2 summarize with no groups and no input”](#fix-tql2-summarize-with-no-groups-and-no-input)

TQL2’s `summarize` now returns a single event when used with no groups and no input events just like in TQL1, making `from [] | summarize count=count()` return `{count: 0}` instead of nothing.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4709](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4709).

#### Make `str(enum)` return the name of the enum entry

[Section titled “Make str(enum) return the name of the enum entry”](#make-strenum-return-the-name-of-the-enum-entry)

The `str` function no longer returns the numeric index of an enumeration value. Instead, the result is now the actual name associated with that value.
