# VAST 2020.09.30

Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/releases/tag/2020.09.30).

### Features

[Section titled “Features”](#features)

#### Restructure vast status

[Section titled “Restructure vast status”](#restructure-vast-status)

The output of the `status` command was restructured with a strong focus on usability. The new flags `--detailed` and `--debug` add additional content to the output.

#### Flatbufferize index

[Section titled “Flatbufferize index”](#flatbufferize-index)

VAST now ships with a new tool `lsvast` to display information about the contents of a VAST database directory. See `lsvast --help` for usage instructions.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#863](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/863).

#### Merge contents of all configuration files

[Section titled “Merge contents of all configuration files”](#merge-contents-of-all-configuration-files)

VAST now merges the contents of all used configuration files instead of using only the most user-specific file. The file specified using `--config` takes the highest precedence, followed by the user-specific path `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-${HOME}/.config}/vast/vast.conf`, and the compile-time path `<sysconfdir>/vast/vast.conf`.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1040](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1040).

#### Add a get subcommand to retrieve events from the archive directly

[Section titled “Add a get subcommand to retrieve events from the archive directly”](#add-a-get-subcommand-to-retrieve-events-from-the-archive-directly)

The `vast get` command has been added. It retrieves events from the database directly by their ids.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#938](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/938).

#### Make vast.conf lookup on Linux systems more intuitive

[Section titled “Make vast.conf lookup on Linux systems more intuitive”](#make-vastconf-lookup-on-linux-systems-more-intuitive)

VAST now supports the XDG base directory specification: The `vast.conf` is now found at `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-${HOME}/.config}/vast/vast.conf`, and schema files at `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-${HOME}/.local/share}/vast/schema/`. The user-specific configuration file takes precedence over the global configuration file in `<sysconfdir>/vast/vast.conf`.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1036](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1036).

### Changes

[Section titled “Changes”](#changes)

#### PRs 1045-1055-1059-1062

[Section titled “PRs 1045-1055-1059-1062”](#prs-1045-1055-1059-1062)

The proprietary VAST configuration file has changed to the more ops-friendly industry standard YAML. This change introduced also a new dependency: [yaml-cpp](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp) version 0.6.2 or greater. The top-level `vast.yaml.example` illustrates how the new YAML config looks like. Please rename existing configuration files from `vast.conf` to `vast.yaml`. VAST still reads `vast.conf` but will soon only look for `vast.yaml` or `vast.yml` files in available configuration file paths.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#1045](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1045).

#### Add event type name to the record batch metadata

[Section titled “Add event type name to the record batch metadata”](#add-event-type-name-to-the-record-batch-metadata)

Data exported in the Apache Arrow format now contains the name of the payload record type in the metadata section of the schema.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#1072](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1072).

#### Render duration and port as JSON strings

[Section titled “Render duration and port as JSON strings”](#render-duration-and-port-as-json-strings)

The JSON export format now renders `duration` and `port` fields using strings as opposed to numbers. This avoids a possible loss of information and enables users to re-use the output in follow-up queries directly.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1034](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1034).

#### Make periodic logging more sensible

[Section titled “Make periodic logging more sensible”](#make-periodic-logging-more-sensible)

The delay between the periodic log messages for reporting the current event rates has been increased to 10 seconds.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#1035](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1035).

#### Make vast.conf lookup on Linux systems more intuitive

[Section titled “Make vast.conf lookup on Linux systems more intuitive”](#make-vastconf-lookup-on-linux-systems-more-intuitive-1)

The global VAST configuration now always resides in `<sysconfdir>/vast/vast.conf`, and bundled schemas always in `<datadir>/vast/schema/`. VAST no longer supports reading a `vast.conf` file in the current working directory.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1036](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1036).

#### Flatbufferize index

[Section titled “Flatbufferize index”](#flatbufferize-index-1)

The persistent storage format of the index now uses FlatBuffers.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#863](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/863).

#### Improve import batching options

[Section titled “Improve import batching options”](#improve-import-batching-options)

The options that affect batches in the `import` command received new, more user-facing names: `import.table-slice-type`, `import.table-slice-size`, and `import.read-timeout` are now called `import.batch-encoding`, `import.batch-size`, and `import.read-timeout` respectively.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1058](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1058).

#### Flatbufferize index

[Section titled “Flatbufferize index”](#flatbufferize-index-2)

We refactored the index architecture to improve stability and responsiveness. This includes fixes for several shutdown issues.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#863](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/863).

#### Restructure configuration file hierarchy

[Section titled “Restructure configuration file hierarchy”](#restructure-configuration-file-hierarchy)

All configuration options are now grouped into `vast` and `caf` sections, depending on whether they affect VAST itself or are handed through to the underlying actor framework CAF directly. Take a look at the bundled `vast.yaml.example` file for an explanation of the new layout.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1073](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1073).

### Bug Fixes

[Section titled “Bug Fixes”](#bug-fixes)

#### Improve import batching options

[Section titled “Improve import batching options”](#improve-import-batching-options-1)

Stalled sources that were unable to generate new events no longer stop import processes from shutting down under rare circumstances.
