### Features

[Section titled “Features”](#features)

#### PRs 1987-1992

[Section titled “PRs 1987-1992”](#prs-1987-1992)

Metrics events now optionally contain a metadata field that is a key-value mapping of string to string, allowing for finer-grained introspection. For now this enables correlation of metrics events and individual queries. A set of new metrics for query lookup use this feature to include the query ID.

#### Make JSON field selectors configurable

[Section titled “Make JSON field selectors configurable”](#make-json-field-selectors-configurable)

JSON field selectors are now configurable instead of being hard-coded for Suricata Eve JSON and Zeek Streaming JSON. E.g., `vast import json --selector=event_type:suricata` is now equivalent to `vast import suricata`. This allows for easier integration of JSONL data containing a field that indicates its type.

#### Emit version column along with metrics

[Section titled “Emit version column along with metrics”](#emit-version-column-along-with-metrics)

All metrics events now contain the version of VAST. Additionally, VAST now emits startup and shutdown metrics at the start and stop of the VAST server.

### Changes

[Section titled “Changes”](#changes)

#### Type FlatBuffers

[Section titled “Type FlatBuffers”](#type-flatbuffers)

VAST’s internal type system has a new on-disk data representation. While we still support reading older databases, reverting to an older version of VAST will not be possible after this change. Alongside this change, we’ve implemented numerous fixes and streamlined handling of field name lookups, which now more consistently handles the dot-separator. E.g., the query `#field == "ip"` still matches the field `source.ip`, but no longer the field `source_ip`. The change is also performance-relevant in the long-term: For data persisted from previous versions of VAST we convert to the new type system on the fly, and for newly ingested data we now have near zero-cost deserialization for types, which should result in an overall speedup once the old data is rotated out by the disk monitor.

#### Fix JSON default selector for nested records

[Section titled “Fix JSON default selector for nested records”](#fix-json-default-selector-for-nested-records)

The field-based default selector of the JSON import now correctly matches types with nested record types.
