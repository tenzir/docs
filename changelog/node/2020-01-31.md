# VAST 2020.01.31

Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/releases/tag/2020.01.31).

### Features

[Section titled “Features”](#features)

#### Add -c as shorthand for —config

[Section titled “Add -c as shorthand for —config”](#add--c-as-shorthand-for-config)

The long option `--config`, which sets an explicit path to the VAST configuration file, now also has the short option `-c`.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#689](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/689).

#### PRs 632-726

[Section titled “PRs 632-726”](#prs-632-726)

When a record field has the `#index=hash` attribute, VAST will choose an optimized index implementation. This new index type only supports (in)equality queries and is therefore intended to be used with opaque types, such as unique identifiers or random strings.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#632](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/632).

#### Add support for Apache Arrow

[Section titled “Add support for Apache Arrow”](#add-support-for-apache-arrow)

Added *Apache Arrow* as new export format. This allows users to export query results as Apache Arrow record batches for processing the results downstream, e.g., in Python or Spark.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#633](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/633).

#### Allow configuring pcap snapshot length

[Section titled “Allow configuring pcap snapshot length”](#allow-configuring-pcap-snapshot-length)

The `import pcap` command now takes an optional snapshot length via `--snaplen`. If the snapshot length is set to snaplen, and snaplen is less than the size of a packet that is captured, only the first snaplen bytes of that packet will be captured and provided as packet data.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#642](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/642).

#### Add FreeBSD rc.d script

[Section titled “Add FreeBSD rc.d script”](#add-freebsd-rcd-script)

On FreeBSD, a VAST installation now includes an rc.d script that simpliefies spinning up a VAST node. CMake installs the script at `PREFIX/etc/rc.d/vast`.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#693](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/693).

#### Add Python module for submitting queries to VAST

[Section titled “Add Python module for submitting queries to VAST”](#add-python-module-for-submitting-queries-to-vast)

An experimental new Python module enables querying VAST and processing results as [pyarrow](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/) tables.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#685](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/685).

### Changes

[Section titled “Changes”](#changes)

#### Add Python module for submitting queries to VAST

[Section titled “Add Python module for submitting queries to VAST”](#add-python-module-for-submitting-queries-to-vast-1)

Record field names can now be entered as quoted strings in the schema and expression languages. This lifts a restriction where JSON fields with whitespaces or special characters could not be ingested.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#685](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/685).

#### Minor parser changes

[Section titled “Minor parser changes”](#minor-parser-changes)

Two minor modifications were done in the parsing framework: (i) the parsers for enums and records now allow trailing separators, and (ii) the dash (`-`) was removed from the allowed characters of schema type names.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#706](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/706).

#### Add separate interface option for import pcap

[Section titled “Add separate interface option for import pcap”](#add-separate-interface-option-for-import-pcap)

The `import pcap` command no longer takes interface names via `--read,-r`, but instead from a separate option named `--interface,-i`. This change has been made for consistency with other tools.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#641](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/641).

#### Switch to a calendar-based versioning scheme

[Section titled “Switch to a calendar-based versioning scheme”](#switch-to-a-calendar-based-versioning-scheme)

VAST is switching to a calendar-based versioning scheme starting with this release.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#739](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/739).

#### Perform pass over build config defaults

[Section titled “Perform pass over build config defaults”](#perform-pass-over-build-config-defaults)

Build configuration defaults have been adapated for a better user experience. Installations are now relocatable by default, which can be reverted by configuring with `--without-relocatable`. Additionally, new sets of defaults named `--release` and `--debug` (renamed from `--dev-mode`) have been added.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#695](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/695).

### Bug Fixes

[Section titled “Bug Fixes”](#bug-fixes)

#### Fix configuration file option parsing

[Section titled “Fix configuration file option parsing”](#fix-configuration-file-option-parsing)

The example configuration file contained an invalid section `vast`. This has been changed to the correct name `system`.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#705](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/705).

#### Fix datagram source actor not running heartbeat

[Section titled “Fix datagram source actor not running heartbeat”](#fix-datagram-source-actor-not-running-heartbeat)

The import process did not print statistics when importing events over UDP. Additionally, warnings about dropped UDP packets are no longer shown per packet, but rather periodically reported in a readable format.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#662](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/662).

#### Fix race in index lookup

[Section titled “Fix race in index lookup”](#fix-race-in-index-lookup)

A race condition in the index logic was able to lead to incomplete or empty result sets for `vast export`.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#703](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/703).

#### Refactor importer initialization

[Section titled “Refactor importer initialization”](#refactor-importer-initialization)

In some cases it was possible that a source would connect to a node before it was fully initialized, resulting in a hanging `vast import` process.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#647](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/647).

#### Ignore VLAN tags in PCAP import

[Section titled “Ignore VLAN tags in PCAP import”](#ignore-vlan-tags-in-pcap-import)

PCAP ingestion failed for traces containing VLAN tags. VAST now strips [IEEE 802.1Q](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.1Q) headers instead of skipping VLAN-tagged packets.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#650](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/650).

#### Register the accountant for datagram sources

[Section titled “Register the accountant for datagram sources”](#register-the-accountant-for-datagram-sources)

Importing events over UDP with `vast import <format> --listen :<port>/udp` failed to register the accountant component. This caused an unexpected message warning to be printed on startup and resulted in losing import statistics. VAST now correctly registers the accountant.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#655](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/655).

#### Add Python module for submitting queries to VAST

[Section titled “Add Python module for submitting queries to VAST”](#add-python-module-for-submitting-queries-to-vast-2)

A bug in the quoted string parser caused a parsing failure if an escape character occurred in the last position.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#685](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/685).
