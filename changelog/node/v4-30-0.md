# Tenzir Node v4.30.0

Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/releases/tag/v4.30.0).

### Features

[Section titled “Features”](#features)

#### Add a global ca-certificates config option

[Section titled “Add a global ca-certificates config option”](#add-a-global-ca-certificates-config-option)

We introduced common TLS settings for all operators that support TLS. The Tenzir config now has a key `cacert`, which will set the CA certificate file for all operators using it. The default for this will be chosen appropriately for the system.

#### Add `to_clickhouse` operator

[Section titled “Add to\_clickhouse operator”](#add-to_clickhouse-operator)

We have added a new `to_clickhouse` operator, which enables you to easily send events to ClickHouse.

#### Port `load_gcs` and `save_gcs` to TQL2

[Section titled “Port load\_gcs and save\_gcs to TQL2”](#port-load_gcs-and-save_gcs-to-tql2)

The `load_gcs` and `save_gcs` operators are now available in TQL2 to interact with Google Cloud Storage.

#### Implement an `assert_throughput` operator

[Section titled “Implement an assert\_throughput operator”](#implement-an-assert_throughput-operator)

The new `assert_throughput` operators allows for checking whether a pipeline meets the minimum expected throughput at any place in the pipeline.

#### Introduce `metrics "pipeline"`

[Section titled “Introduce metrics "pipeline"”](#introduce-metrics-pipeline)

`metrics "pipeline"` provides an easy way to view the ingress and egress of pipelines. The new metrics show the ingress and egress of every pipeline in windows of ten seconds.

### Changes

[Section titled “Changes”](#changes)

#### Add a global ca-certificates config option

[Section titled “Add a global ca-certificates config option”](#add-a-global-ca-certificates-config-option-1)

The `skip_host_verification` option has been removed from the `load_http`, `save_email` and `save_http` operators. Its functionality has been merged into the `skip_peer_verification` option.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#5022](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5022).

#### Introduce `metrics "pipeline"`

[Section titled “Introduce metrics "pipeline"”](#introduce-metrics-pipeline-1)

`metrics "operator"` is now deprecated. Use `metrics "pipeline"` instead, which offers a pre-aggregated view of pipeline metrics. We plan to remove operator metrics in an upcoming release, as they are too expensive in large-scale deployments.

### Bug Fixes

[Section titled “Bug Fixes”](#bug-fixes)

#### Fix passing string params to `{from,to}_fluent_bit`

[Section titled “Fix passing string params to {from,to}\_fluent\_bit”](#fix-passing-string-params-to-fromto_fluent_bit)

We fixed a regression that caused strings passed as options to the `from_fluent_bit` and `to_fluent_bit` operators to incorrectly be surrounded by double quotes.

`to_fluent_bit` incorrectly reported zero bytes being pushed to the Fluent Bit engine as an error. This no longer happens.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#5053](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5053).

#### Fix bug that caused `read_zeek_tsv` to produce invalid fields

[Section titled “Fix bug that caused read\_zeek\_tsv to produce invalid fields”](#fix-bug-that-caused-read_zeek_tsv-to-produce-invalid-fields)

The `read_zeek_tsv` operator sometimes produced an invalid field with the name `\0` for types without a schema specified. This no longer happens.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#5052](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5052).

#### Fix crash in `from "path/to/file.ndjson"`

[Section titled “Fix crash in from "path/to/file.ndjson"”](#fix-crash-in-from-pathtofilendjson)

The `from` operator no longer incorrectly attempts to use parsers with a known file extension that is a suffix of the actual file extension. For example, `from "file.foojson"` will no longer attempt to use the `json` parser by default, while `from "file.foo.json"` and `from "file.json"` continue to work as expected. This fixes an error for `.ndjson` files, which could previously not decide between the `json` and `ndjson` parsers.
