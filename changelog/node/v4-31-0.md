### Features

[Section titled “Features”](#features)

#### Implement `if … else` expressions and short-circuiting for `and` / `or`

[Section titled “Implement if … else expressions and short-circuiting for and / or”](#implement-if--else-expressions-and-short-circuiting-for-and--or)

Tenzir now supports inline `if … else` expressions in the form `foo if pred`, which returns `foo` if `pred` evaluates to `true`, or `null` otherwise, and `foo if pred else bar`, which instead of falling back to `null` falls back to `bar`.

#### Implement `from_opensearch`

[Section titled “Implement from\_opensearch”](#implement-from_opensearch)

We added a `from_opensearch` operator that presents a OpenSearch-compatible REST API to enable easy interop with tools that can send data to OpenSearch or Elasticsearch, e.g. Filebeat, Winlogbeat etc.

### Bug Fixes

[Section titled “Bug Fixes”](#bug-fixes)

#### Implement `if … else` expressions and short-circuiting for `and` / `or`

[Section titled “Implement if … else expressions and short-circuiting for and / or”](#implement-if--else-expressions-and-short-circuiting-for-and--or-1)

The binary operators `and` and `or` now skip evaluating their right-hand side when not necessary. For example, `where this.has("foo") and foo == 42` now avoids emitting a warning when `foo` does not exist.

#### Hardcode the fluent-bit page size to 24576

[Section titled “Hardcode the fluent-bit page size to 24576”](#hardcode-the-fluent-bit-page-size-to-24576)

The `from_fluent_bit` and `to_fluent_bit` operators no longer crash when trying to handle very large payloads.
