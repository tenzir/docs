#### Build an RPM package

[Section titled “Build an RPM package”](#build-an-rpm-package)

We now offer an RPM package for RedHat Linux and its derivatives.

#### Support multiple fields in `sort`

[Section titled “Support multiple fields in sort”](#support-multiple-fields-in-sort)

The `sort` operator now supports sorting by multiple fields.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4242](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4242).

#### Add an option to `export` both past and future events

[Section titled “Add an option to export both past and future events”](#add-an-option-to-export-both-past-and-future-events)

The `export`, `metrics`, and `diagnostics` operators now features a `--retro` flag. This flag will make the operators first export past events, even when `--live` is set. Specify both options explicitly to first return past events and then immediately switch into live mode.

By [@IyeOnline](https://github.com/IyeOnline) in [#4203](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4203).

#### Allow editing definitions of managed pipelines

[Section titled “Allow editing definitions of managed pipelines”](#allow-editing-definitions-of-managed-pipelines)

The `/pipeline/update` API endpoint now supports updating definitions of existing pipelines.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#4196](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4196).

#### Support IP-in-subnet queries in lookup tables

[Section titled “Support IP-in-subnet queries in lookup tables”](#support-ip-in-subnet-queries-in-lookup-tables)

The `lookup-table` context now performs longest-prefix matches when the table key is of type `subnet` and the to-be-enriched field of type `ip`. For example, a lookup table with key `10.0.0.0/8` will match when enriching the IP address `10.1.1.1`.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#4051](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4051).

#### Support disabling TLS in `https` connector

[Section titled “Support disabling TLS in https connector”](#support-disabling-tls-in-https-connector)

The `https` connector supports the new options `--skip-peer-verification` and `--skip-hostname-verification` to disable verification of the peer’s certificate and verification of the certificate hostname.

### Bug Fixes

[Section titled “Bug Fixes”](#bug-fixes)

#### Support multiple table slice schemas when dumping contexts

[Section titled “Support multiple table slice schemas when dumping contexts”](#support-multiple-table-slice-schemas-when-dumping-contexts)

`context inspect` will not crash anymore when encountering contexts that contain multi-schema data.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#4236](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4236).

#### Add an option to `export` both past and future events

[Section titled “Add an option to export both past and future events”](#add-an-option-to-export-both-past-and-future-events-1)

`export --live` no longer buffers the last batch of event that was imported, and instead immediately returns all imported events.

By [@IyeOnline](https://github.com/IyeOnline) in [#4203](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4203).

#### Add label definitions to configured pipelines

[Section titled “Add label definitions to configured pipelines”](#add-label-definitions-to-configured-pipelines-1)

Pipelines configured as code no longer always restart with the node. Instead, just like for other pipelines, they only restart when they were running before the node shut down.
