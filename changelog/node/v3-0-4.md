#### Fix partition selection for the `rebuild` command

[Section titled “Fix partition selection for the rebuild command”](#fix-partition-selection-for-the-rebuild-command)

The `--all` flag for the `rebuild` command now consistently causes all partitions to be rebuilt, aligning its functionality with its documentation.
