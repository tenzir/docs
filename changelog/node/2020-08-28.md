# VAST 2020.08.28

Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/releases/tag/2020.08.28).

### Features

[Section titled “Features”](#features)

#### Always convert JSON null to VAST nil

[Section titled “Always convert JSON null to VAST nil”](#always-convert-json-null-to-vast-nil)

The default schema for Suricata has been updated to support the `suricata.ftp` and `suricata.ftp_data` event types.

VAST now prints the location of the configuration file that is used.

#### Protect DB directory with PID lock

[Section titled “Protect DB directory with PID lock”](#protect-db-directory-with-pid-lock)

VAST now writes a PID lock file on startup to prevent multiple server processes from accessing the same persistent state. The `pid.lock` file resides in the `vast.db` directory.

### Changes

[Section titled “Changes”](#changes)

#### Rename vector to list

[Section titled “Rename vector to list”](#rename-vector-to-list)

The `vector` type has been renamed to `list`. In an effort to streamline the type system vocabulary, we favor `list` over `vector` because it’s closer to existing terminology (e.g., Apache Arrow). This change requires updating existing schemas by changing `vector<T>` to `list<T>`.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#1016](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1016).

#### Allow the ’-’ in the expression key parser

[Section titled “Allow the ’-’ in the expression key parser”](#allow-the---in-the-expression-key-parser)

The expression field parser now allows the ’-’ character.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#999](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/999).

#### Remove set data type

[Section titled “Remove set data type”](#remove-set-data-type)

The `set` type has been removed. Experience with the data model showed that there is no strong use case to separate sets from vectors in the core. While this may be useful in programming languages, VAST deals with immutable data where set constraints have been enforced upstream. This change requires updating existing schemas by changing `set<T>` to `vector<T>`. In the query language, the new symbol for the empty `map` changed from `{-}` to `{}`, as it now unambiguously identifies `map` instances.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#1010](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1010).

#### Expand CAF stream slot ids to 32 bits

[Section titled “Expand CAF stream slot ids to 32 bits”](#expand-caf-stream-slot-ids-to-32-bits)

We now bundle a patched version of CAF, with a changed ABI. This means that if you’re linking against the bundled CAF library, you also need to distribute that library so that VAST can use it at runtime. The versions are API compatible so linking against a system version of CAF is still possible and supported.

### Bug Fixes

[Section titled “Bug Fixes”](#bug-fixes)

#### Fix bug in decoding multi-object MsgPack types

[Section titled “Fix bug in decoding multi-object MsgPack types”](#fix-bug-in-decoding-multi-object-msgpack-types)

MessagePack-encoded table slices now work correctly for nested container types.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#984](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/984).

#### Expand CAF stream slot ids to 32 bits

[Section titled “Expand CAF stream slot ids to 32 bits”](#expand-caf-stream-slot-ids-to-32-bits-1)

When running VAST under heavy load, CAF stream slot ids could wrap around after a few days and deadlock the system. As a workaround, we extended the slot id bit width to make the time until this happens unrealistically large.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#1020](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1020).

#### Allow the ’-’ in the expression key parser

[Section titled “Allow the ’-’ in the expression key parser”](#allow-the---in-the-expression-key-parser-1)

A bug in the expression parser prevented the correct parsing of fields starting with either ‘F’ or ‘T’.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#999](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/999).

#### Terminate exporters when sinks die

[Section titled “Terminate exporters when sinks die”](#terminate-exporters-when-sinks-die)

When continuous query in a client process terminated, the node did not clean up the corresponding server-side state. This memory leak no longer exists.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#1006](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1006).

#### Support hard-kill for unresponsive actors

[Section titled “Support hard-kill for unresponsive actors”](#support-hard-kill-for-unresponsive-actors)

The shutdown process of the server process could potentially hang forever. VAST now uses a 2-step procedure that first attempts to terminate all components cleanly. If that fails, it will attempt a hard kill afterwards, and if that fails after another timeout, the process will call `abort(3)`.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#1005](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1005).

#### Make port-encoding for Arrow host-independent

[Section titled “Make port-encoding for Arrow host-independent”](#make-port-encoding-for-arrow-host-independent)

The port encoding for Arrow-encoded table slices is now host-independent and always uses network-byte order.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1007](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1007).

#### Close file descriptor by default in ‘vast::file’

[Section titled “Close file descriptor by default in ‘vast::file’”](#close-file-descriptor-by-default-in-vastfile)

Some file descriptors remained open when they weren’t needed any more. This descriptor leak has been fixed.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#1018](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1018).

#### Always convert JSON null to VAST nil

[Section titled “Always convert JSON null to VAST nil”](#always-convert-json-null-to-vast-nil-1)

Importing JSON no longer fails for JSON fields containing `null` when the corresponding VAST type in the schema is a non-trivial type like `vector<string>`.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1009](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1009).

#### Correct the use of ::read()

[Section titled “Correct the use of ::read()”](#correct-the-use-of-read)

Incomplete reads have not been handled properly, which manifested for files larger than 2GB. On macOS, writing files larger than 2GB may have failed previously. VAST now respects OS-specific constraints on the maximum block size.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#1025](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1025).

#### Shutdown node when component startup fails

[Section titled “Shutdown node when component startup fails”](#shutdown-node-when-component-startup-fails)

VAST did not terminate when a critical component failed during startup. VAST now binds the lifetime of the node to all critical components.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#1028](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1028).

#### Don’t overwrite index state after startup error

[Section titled “Don’t overwrite index state after startup error”](#dont-overwrite-index-state-after-startup-error)

VAST would overwrite existing on-disk state data when encountering a partial read during startup. This state-corrupting behavior no longer exists.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#1026](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1026).
