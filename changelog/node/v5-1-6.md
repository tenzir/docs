### Features

[Section titled “Features”](#features)

#### Add `hour`, `minute`, and `second` time component extraction

[Section titled “Add hour, minute, and second time component extraction”](#add-hour-minute-and-second-time-component-extraction)

The `hour`, `minute`, and `second` functions extract the respective components of a `time` value, and compliment the existing `year`, `month`, and `day` functions. The `second` function includes subsecond precision.

### Changes

[Section titled “Changes”](#changes)

#### Remove deprecated `as_secs()` function

[Section titled “Remove deprecated as\_secs() function”](#remove-deprecated-as_secs-function)

We removed the deprecated `<duration>.as_secs()` function which has been superseded by `<duration>.count_seconds()` quite some time ago. The `count_seconds()` function provides the same functionality with a more consistent naming convention that aligns with other duration-related functions like `count_minutes()`, `count_hours()`, etc.

### Bug Fixes

[Section titled “Bug Fixes”](#bug-fixes)

#### Fix a hang in `if` for stalled inputs

[Section titled “Fix a hang in if for stalled inputs”](#fix-a-hang-in-if-for-stalled-inputs)

We fixed a regression in the `if` statement that caused it to indefinitely withhold the last batch of events when its input stalled.

#### Handle assert gracefully in `write_syslog`

[Section titled “Handle assert gracefully in write\_syslog”](#handle-assert-gracefully-in-write_syslog)

We now gracefully handle a panic in `write_syslog`, when `structured_data` does not have the expected shape.
