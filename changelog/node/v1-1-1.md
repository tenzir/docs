The disk monitor now correctly continues deleting until below the low water mark after a partition failed to delete.

We fixed a rarely occurring race condition caused query workers to become stuck after delivering all results until the corresponding client process terminated.

Queries that timed out or were externally terminated while in the query backlog and with more than five unhandled candidate partitions no longer permanently get stuck.
