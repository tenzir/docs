### Features

[Section titled “Features”](#features)

#### Add `apply` operator

[Section titled “Add apply operator”](#add-apply-operator)

The new `apply` operator includes pipelines defined in other files.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#3677](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3677).

#### Add `parse` operator

[Section titled “Add parse operator”](#add-parse-operator)

The new, experimental `parse` operator applies a parser to the string stored in a given field.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#3665](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3665).

#### Add `from/load/to/save <uri/file>`

[Section titled “Add from/load/to/save \<uri/file>”](#add-fromloadtosave-urifile)

The operators `from`, `to`, `load`, and `save` support using URLs and file paths directly as their argument. For example, `load https://example.com` means `load https https://example.com`, and `save local-file.json` means `save file local-file.json`.

By [@eliaskosunen](https://github.com/eliaskosunen) in [#3608](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3608).

#### Add `syslog` parser

[Section titled “Add syslog parser”](#add-syslog-parser)

The `syslog` parser allows reading both RFC 5424 and RFC 3164 syslog messages.

By [@eliaskosunen](https://github.com/eliaskosunen) in [#3645](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3645).

#### Add `yield` operator

[Section titled “Add yield operator”](#add-yield-operator)

The new `yield` operator extracts nested records with the ability to unfold lists.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#3651](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3651).

#### Introduce an experimental `python` pipeline operator

[Section titled “Introduce an experimental python pipeline operator”](#introduce-an-experimental-python-pipeline-operator)

The `python` operator adds the ability to perform arbitrary event to event transformations with the full power of Python 3.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#3592](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3592).

#### Implement a TCP loader

[Section titled “Implement a TCP loader”](#implement-a-tcp-loader)

We added a new `tcp` connector that allows reading raw bytes from TCP or TLS connections.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3664](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3664).

#### Add file extension detection to `from`/`to`

[Section titled “Add file extension detection to from/to”](#add-file-extension-detection-to-fromto)

When using `from <URL>` and `to <URL>` without specifying the format explicitly using a `read`/`write` argument, the default format is determined by the file extension for all loaders and savers, if possible. Previously, that was only done when using the `file` loader/saver. Additionally, if the file name would indicate some sort of compression (e.g. `.gz`), compression and decompression is performed automatically. For example, `from https://example.com/myfile.yml.gz` is expanded to `load https://example.com/myfile.yml.gz | decompress gzip | read yaml` automatically.

By [@eliaskosunen](https://github.com/eliaskosunen) in [#3653](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3653).

#### Support `show`-ing all aspects at once

[Section titled “Support show-ing all aspects at once”](#support-show-ing-all-aspects-at-once)

Use `show` without an aspect to return information about all aspects of a node.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3650](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3650).

#### Implement context backends for the contextualizer

[Section titled “Implement context backends for the contextualizer”](#implement-context-backends-for-the-contextualizer)

The closed-source `context` plugin offers a backend functionality for finding matches between data sets.

The new `lookup-table` built-in is a hashtable-based contextualization algorithm that enriches events based on a unique value.

The JSON format has a new `--arrays-of-objects` parameter that allows for parsing a JSON array of JSON objects into an event for each object.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#3684](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3684).

#### Add ‘min\_events’ parameters to /serve endpoint

[Section titled “Add ‘min\_events’ parameters to /serve endpoint”](#add-min_events-parameters-to-serve-endpoint)

We optimized the behavior of the ‘serve’ operator to respond quicker and cause less system load for pipelines that take a long time to generate the first result. The new `min_events` parameter can be used to implement long-polling behavior for clients of `/serve`.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#3666](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3666).

#### Support comments in xsv parser

[Section titled “Support comments in xsv parser”](#support-comments-in-xsv-parser)

Use `--allow-comments` with the `xsv` parser (incl. `csv`, `tsv`, and `ssv`) to treat lines beginning with `'#'` as comments.

By [@eliaskosunen](https://github.com/eliaskosunen) in [#3681](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3681).

#### Add `export --internal` to access metrics

[Section titled “Add export --internal to access metrics”](#add-export---internal-to-access-metrics)

The new `--internal` flag for the `export` operators returns internal events collected by the system, for example pipeline metrics.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#3619](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3619).

### Changes

[Section titled “Changes”](#changes)

#### Rename pytenzir to tenzir

[Section titled “Rename pytenzir to tenzir”](#rename-pytenzir-to-tenzir)

We renamed the name of our python package from `pytenzir` to `tenzir`.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#3660](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3660).

#### Implement a TCP loader

[Section titled “Implement a TCP loader”](#implement-a-tcp-loader-1)

We renamed the `--bind` option of the `zmq` connector to `--listen`.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3664](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3664).

#### Consider discard, export, and import as internal operators

[Section titled “Consider discard, export, and import as internal operators”](#consider-discard-export-and-import-as-internal-operators)

Ingress and egress metrics for pipelines now indicate whether the pipeline sent/received events to/from outside of the node with a new `internal` flag. For example, when using the `export` operator, data is entering the pipeline from within the node, so its ingress is considered internal.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3658](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3658).

### Bug Fixes

[Section titled “Bug Fixes”](#bug-fixes)

#### Add `export --internal` to access metrics

[Section titled “Add export --internal to access metrics”](#add-export---internal-to-access-metrics-1)

`export --live` now respects a subsequent `where <expr>` instead of silently discarding the filter expression.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#3619](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3619).

#### Support lists and null values and empty strings in XSV parser

[Section titled “Support lists and null values and empty strings in XSV parser”](#support-lists-and-null-values-and-empty-strings-in-xsv-parser)

The `csv`, `ssv`, and `tsv` parsers now correctly support empty strings, lists, and null values.

The `tail` operator no longer hangs occasionally.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3687](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3687).

#### Fix `sort` type check

[Section titled “Fix sort type check”](#fix-sort-type-check)

Using the `sort` operator with polymorphic inputs no longer leads to a failing assertion under some circumstances.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#3655](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3655).
