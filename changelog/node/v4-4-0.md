Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/releases/tag/v4.4.0).

### Features

[Section titled “Features”](#features)

#### Add `show serves` for debugging the `serve` operator

[Section titled “Add show serves for debugging the serve operator”](#add-show-serves-for-debugging-the-serve-operator)

`show serves` displays all currently active serve IDs in the `/serve` API endpoint, showing an overview of active pipelines with an on-demand API.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3596](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3596).

#### Implement a RabbitMQ-based AMQP connector

[Section titled “Implement a RabbitMQ-based AMQP connector”](#implement-a-rabbitmq-based-amqp-connector)

The new `amqp` connector enables interaction with an AMQP 0-9-1 exchange, supporting working with messages as producer (saver) and consumer (loader).

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#3546](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3546).

#### Implement extended deployment options

[Section titled “Implement extended deployment options”](#implement-extended-deployment-options)

The new `ttl_expires_in_ns` shows the remaining time to live for a pipeline in the pipeline manager.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#3585](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3585).

#### Add a `yara` operator

[Section titled “Add a yara operator”](#add-a-yara-operator)

The new `yara` operator matches Yara rules on byte streams, producing structured events when rules match.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#3594](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3594).

#### Add `blob` type for arbitrary binary data

[Section titled “Add blob type for arbitrary binary data”](#add-blob-type-for-arbitrary-binary-data)

The new `blob` type can be used to represent arbitrary binary data.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#3581](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3581).

#### Add a —live option to the export operator

[Section titled “Add a —live option to the export operator”](#add-a-live-option-to-the-export-operator)

The `export` operator now has a `--live` option to continuously emit events as they are imported instead of those that already reside in the database.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#3612](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3612).

#### Add a `velociraptor` operator

[Section titled “Add a velociraptor operator”](#add-a-velociraptor-operator)

The new `velociraptor` source supports submitting VQL queries to a Velociraptor server. The operator communicates with the server via gRPC using a mutually authenticated and encrypted connection with client certificates. For example, `velociraptor -q "select * from pslist()"` lists processes and their running binaries.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#3556](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3556).

#### Update the plugins submodule pointer to include extended & serialized pipeline states

[Section titled “Update the plugins submodule pointer to include extended & serialized pipeline states”](#update-the-plugins-submodule-pointer-to-include-extended--serialized-pipeline-states)

The new `completed` pipeline state in the pipeline manager shows when a pipeline has finished execution.

If the node with running pipelines crashes, they will be marked as `failed` upon restarting.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#3554](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3554).

#### Add `events` field to output of `show partitions`

[Section titled “Add events field to output of show partitions”](#add-events-field-to-output-of-show-partitions)

The output of `show partitions` includes a new `events` field that shows the number of events kept in that partition. E.g., the pipeline `show partitions | summarize events=sum(events) by schema` shows the number of events per schema stored at the node.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3580](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3580).

### Changes

[Section titled “Changes”](#changes)

#### Implement extended deployment options

[Section titled “Implement extended deployment options”](#implement-extended-deployment-options-1)

The new `autostart` and `autodelete` parameters for the pipeline manager supersede the `start_when_created` and `restart_with_node` parameters and extend restarting and deletion possibilities for pipelines.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#3585](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3585).

#### Add `blob` type for arbitrary binary data

[Section titled “Add blob type for arbitrary binary data”](#add-blob-type-for-arbitrary-binary-data-1)

The `string` type is now restricted to valid UTF-8 strings. Use `blob` for arbitrary binary data.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#3581](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3581).

### Bug Fixes

[Section titled “Bug Fixes”](#bug-fixes)

#### Detect and report incomplete object in JSON parser

[Section titled “Detect and report incomplete object in JSON parser”](#detect-and-report-incomplete-object-in-json-parser)

When using `read json`, incomplete objects (e.g., due to truncated files) are now reported as an error instead of silently discarded.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#3570](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3570).

#### Fix `serve` exiting prematurely

[Section titled “Fix serve exiting prematurely”](#fix-serve-exiting-prematurely)

Pipelines ending with the `serve` operator no longer incorrectly exit 60 seconds after transferring all events to the `/serve` endpoint, but rather wait until all events were fetched from the endpoint.

Shutting down a node immediately after starting it now no longer waits for all partitions to be loaded.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3562](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3562).

#### Fix parsing of subnet columns in zeek-tsv

[Section titled “Fix parsing of subnet columns in zeek-tsv”](#fix-parsing-of-subnet-columns-in-zeek-tsv)

The `zeek-tsv` parser is now able to handle fields of type `subnet` correctly.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#3606](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3606).

#### Check for duplicate field names in zeek\_tsv\_parser

[Section titled “Check for duplicate field names in zeek\_tsv\_parser”](#check-for-duplicate-field-names-in-zeek_tsv_parser)

Having duplicate field names in `zeek-tsv` data no longer causes a crash, but rather errors out gracefully.

By [@eliaskosunen](https://github.com/eliaskosunen) in [#3578](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3578).

#### Fix predicate pushdown in `export` and other small fixes

[Section titled “Fix predicate pushdown in export and other small fixes”](#fix-predicate-pushdown-in-export-and-other-small-fixes)

A regression in Tenzir v4.3 caused exports to often consider all partitions as candidates. Pipelines of the form `export | where <expr>` now work as expected again and only load relevant partitions from disk.

The long option `--skip-empty` for `read lines` now works as documented.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3599](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3599).

#### Upgrade remaining usages of the adaptive table slice builder

[Section titled “Upgrade remaining usages of the adaptive table slice builder”](#upgrade-remaining-usages-of-the-adaptive-table-slice-builder)

The `csv` parsed (or more generally, the `xsv` parser) now attempts to parse fields in order to infer their types.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#3582](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3582).
