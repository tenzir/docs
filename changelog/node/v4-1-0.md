### Features

[Section titled “Features”](#features)

#### Make `show pipelines` a thing

[Section titled “Make show pipelines a thing”](#make-show-pipelines-a-thing)

The new `show pipelines` aspect displays a list of all managed pipelines.

#### Bump the tenzir-plugins submodule pointer to include the pipeline manager’s failure and rendered diagnostics functionality

[Section titled “Bump the tenzir-plugins submodule pointer to include the pipeline manager’s failure and rendered diagnostics functionality”](#bump-the-tenzir-plugins-submodule-pointer-to-include-the-pipeline-managers-failure-and-rendered-diagnostics-functionality)

The `rendered` field in the pipeline manager diagnostics delivers a displayable version of the diagnostic’s error message.

Pipelines that encounter an error during execution are now in a new `failed` rather than `stopped` state.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#3479](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3479).

#### Introduce an experimental `sigma` operator

[Section titled “Introduce an experimental sigma operator”](#introduce-an-experimental-sigma-operator)

The new `sigma` operator filters its input with Sigma rules and outputs matching events alongside the matched rule.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3138](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3138).

#### Implement `compress` and `decompress` operators

[Section titled “Implement compress and decompress operators”](#implement-compress-and-decompress-operators)

The `compress [--level <level>] <codec>` and `decompress <codec>` operators enable streaming compression and decompression in pipelines for `brotli`, `bz2`, `gzip`, `lz4`, and `zstd`.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3443](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3443).

#### Bump the tenzir-plugins submodule pointer to include the pipeline manager’s resuming and pausing functionality

[Section titled “Bump the tenzir-plugins submodule pointer to include the pipeline manager’s resuming and pausing functionality”](#bump-the-tenzir-plugins-submodule-pointer-to-include-the-pipeline-managers-resuming-and-pausing-functionality)

The `pause` action in the `/pipeline/update` endpoint suspends a pipeline and sets its state to `paused`. Resume it with the `start` action.

Newly created pipelines are now in a new `created` rather than `stopped` state.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#3471](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3471).

#### Implement `show config`

[Section titled “Implement show config”](#implement-show-config)

The `show config` aspect returns the configuration currently in use, combining options set in the configuration file, the command-line, environment options.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3455](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3455).

### Changes

[Section titled “Changes”](#changes)

#### Refactor `show` aspects and rewrite `version`

[Section titled “Refactor show aspects and rewrite version”](#refactor-show-aspects-and-rewrite-version)

The `version` operator no longer exists. Use `show version` to get the Tenzir version instead. The additional information that `version` produced is now available as `show build`, `show dependencies`, and `show plugins`.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#3442](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3442).

### Bug Fixes

[Section titled “Bug Fixes”](#bug-fixes)

#### Tweak the execution node behavior

[Section titled “Tweak the execution node behavior”](#tweak-the-execution-node-behavior)

Pipeline operators that create output independent of their input now emit their output instantly instead of waiting for receiving further input. This makes the `shell` operator more reliable.

The `show <aspect>` operator wrongfully required unsafe pipelines to be allowed for some aspects. This is now fixed.
