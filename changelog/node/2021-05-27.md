# VAST 2021.05.27

Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/releases/tag/2021.05.27).

### Features

[Section titled “Features”](#features)

#### Load plugin schemas after built-in schemas

[Section titled “Load plugin schemas after built-in schemas”](#load-plugin-schemas-after-built-in-schemas)

Plugin schemas are now installed to `<datadir>/vast/plugin/<plugin>/schema`, while VAST’s built-in schemas reside in `<datadir>/vast/schema`. The load order guarantees that plugins are able to reliably override the schemas bundled with VAST.

#### Support optional numeric duration output for JSON

[Section titled “Support optional numeric duration output for JSON”](#support-optional-numeric-duration-output-for-json)

To enable easier post-processing, the new option `vast.export.json.numeric-durations` switches JSON output of `duration` types from human-readable strings (e.g., `"4.2m"`) to numeric (e.g., `252.15`) in fractional seconds.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1628](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1628).

#### Add a timeout option to the export command

[Section titled “Add a timeout option to the export command”](#add-a-timeout-option-to-the-export-command)

The new option `vast export --timeout=<duration>` allows for setting a timeout for VAST queries. Cancelled exports result in a non-zero exit code.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1611](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1611).

#### PRs 1517-1656

[Section titled “PRs 1517-1656”](#prs-1517-1656)

The new *transforms* feature allows VAST to apply transformations to incoming and outgoing data. A transform consists of a sequence of steps that execute sequentially, e.g., to remove, overwrite, hash, encrypt data. A new plugin type makes it easy to write custom transforms.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#1517](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1517).

#### Add step size to disk monitor

[Section titled “Add step size to disk monitor”](#add-step-size-to-disk-monitor)

The new setting `vast.disk-monitor-step-size` enables the disk monitor to remove *N* partitions at once before re-checking if the new size of the database directory is now small enough. This is useful when checking the size of a directory is an expensive operation itself, e.g., on compressed filesystems.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#1655](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1655).

#### Print the remote-version in the status command

[Section titled “Print the remote-version in the status command”](#print-the-remote-version-in-the-status-command)

The `status` command now prints the VAST server version information under the `version` key.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1652](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1652).

### Changes

[Section titled “Changes”](#changes)

#### Don’t send dynamic type information to connecting sources

[Section titled “Don’t send dynamic type information to connecting sources”](#dont-send-dynamic-type-information-to-connecting-sources)

Schemas are no longer implicitly shared between sources, i.e., an `import` process importing data with a custom schema will no longer affect other sources started at a later point in time. Schemas known to the VAST server process are still available to all `import` processes. We do not expect this change to have a real-world impact, but it could break setups where some sources have been installed on hosts without their own schema files, the VAST server did not have up-to-date schema files, and other sources were (ab)used to provide the latest type information.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#1656](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1656).

#### Deprecate builds without Apache Arrow

[Section titled “Deprecate builds without Apache Arrow”](#deprecate-builds-without-apache-arrow)

Building VAST without Apache Arrow via `-DVAST_ENABLE_ARROW=OFF` is now deprecated, and support for the option will be removed in a future release. As the Arrow ecosystem and libraries matured, we feel confident in making it a required dependency and plan to build upon it more in the future.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1682](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1682).

#### Remove configure script

[Section titled “Remove configure script”](#remove-configure-script)

The `configure` script was removed. This was a custom script that mimicked the functionality of an autotools-based `configure` script by writing directly to the cmake cache. Instead, users now must use the `cmake` and/or `ccmake` binaries directly to configure VAST.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#1657](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1657).

### Bug Fixes

[Section titled “Bug Fixes”](#bug-fixes)

#### Sort loaded plugins by name

[Section titled “Sort loaded plugins by name”](#sort-loaded-plugins-by-name)

VAST no longer erroneously warns about a version mismatch between client and server when their plugin load order differs.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1679](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1679).

#### Print the remote-version in the status command

[Section titled “Print the remote-version in the status command”](#print-the-remote-version-in-the-status-command-1)

VAST no longer erroneously skips the version mismatch detection between client and server. The check now additionally compares running plugins.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1652](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1652).

#### Error when initializing a plugin fails

[Section titled “Error when initializing a plugin fails”](#error-when-initializing-a-plugin-fails)

VAST now correctly refuses to run when loaded plugins fail their initialization, i.e., are in a state that cannot be reasoned about.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1618](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1618).

#### Allow for running unit tests in parallel

[Section titled “Allow for running unit tests in parallel”](#allow-for-running-unit-tests-in-parallel)

Executing VAST’s unit test suite in parallel no longer fails.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1659](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1659).

#### Fix install dirs wrt binary relocatability

[Section titled “Fix install dirs wrt binary relocatability”](#fix-install-dirs-wrt-binary-relocatability)

Non-relocatable VAST binaries no longer look for configuration, schemas, and plugins in directories relative to the binary location. Vice versa, relocatable VAST binaries no longer look for configuration, schemas, and plugins in their original install directory, and instead always use paths relative to their binary location. On macOS, we now always build relocatable binaries. Relocatable binaries now work correctly on systems where the libary install directory is `lib64` instead of `lib`.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1624](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1624).

#### Fix the datagram source

[Section titled “Fix the datagram source”](#fix-the-datagram-source)

A recent change caused imports over UDP not to forward its events to the VAST server process. Running `vast import -l :<port>/udp <format>` now works as expected again.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1622](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1622).

#### Fix build without Arrow

[Section titled “Fix build without Arrow”](#fix-build-without-arrow)

VAST and transform plugins now build without Arrow support again.

The `delete` transform step correctly deletes fields from the layout when running VAST with Arrow disabled.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1673](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1673).
