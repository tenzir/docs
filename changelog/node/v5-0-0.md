# TQL2, Always

Tenzir Node v5.0 makes TQL2 the default and only option throughout Tenzir.

Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/releases/tag/v5.0.0).

### Features

[Section titled “Features”](#features)

#### Implement `from_http`

[Section titled “Implement from\_http”](#implement-from_http)

`from_http <host:port>, server=true` creates an HTTP/1.1 server that listens on a specified hostname and port. In the future, the `load_http` operator’s HTTP client will be integrated with this operator as well, eventually superseding `load_http`.

#### Add optimizations for `if`

[Section titled “Add optimizations for if”](#add-optimizations-for-if)

The `mo` suffix allows for specifying durations in terms of months. For example, `3mo` returns a duration equivalent to three months. The unit has alternative spellings `month` and `months`, and is defined as one twelfth of a year.

#### Fix panic in `head 0 | write_json arrays_of_objects=true`

[Section titled “Fix panic in head 0 | write\_json arrays\_of\_objects=true”](#fix-panic-in-head-0--write_json-arrays_of_objectstrue)

`write_json arrays_of_objects=true` now works correctly with an empty input, returning an empty JSON array instead of running into a panic.

#### Implement `move` operator

[Section titled “Implement move operator”](#implement-move-operator)

We added a new `move` operator that moves a field into another, effectively a smart renaming such as `ctx.message=status.msg` moves the values from `status.msg` into the field `message` of a record `ctx` and drops `status.msg`.

#### Add a `hidden` field to `diagnostics`

[Section titled “Add a hidden field to diagnostics”](#add-a-hidden-field-to-diagnostics)

The output of the `diagnostics` operator now includes an additional `hidden` field that is set to `true` for pipelines that are not visible on the Pipelines page of the Tenzir Platform, e.g., because they’re run under-the-hood by the platform or interactively in the Explorer.

### Changes

[Section titled “Changes”](#changes)

#### Make TQL2 the default

[Section titled “Make TQL2 the default”](#make-tql2-the-default)

TQL2 is now the default and only option for writing pipelines with Tenzir. The environment variable `TENZIR_TQL2`, the configuration option `tenzir.tql2` have no more effect. Using the command-line option `--tql2` results in an error.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#5086](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5086).

#### Implement `file_content(path:string)`

[Section titled “Implement file\_content(path:string)”](#implement-file_contentpathstring)

We added a new function `file_contents` to read bytes from a file with an absolute path.

By [@raxyte](https://github.com/raxyte) in [#5111](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5111).

#### Add optimizations for `if`

[Section titled “Add optimizations for if”](#add-optimizations-for-if-1)

`1y` in TQL now equals 365.2425 days, which is the average length of a year in the Gregorian calendar. This aligns the duration literal with the `years` function and how the Tenzir Platform renders durations.

### Bug Fixes

[Section titled “Bug Fixes”](#bug-fixes)

#### Add optimizations for `if`

[Section titled “Add optimizations for if”](#add-optimizations-for-if-2)

Operators that interact with state in the node that is not local to the pipeline, e.g., `context::update`, now properly work when used inside an `if` statement. Previously, pipelines of the form `if … { context::update … }` failed at runtime.

Branches in `if` statement no longer run on a single thread, and instead properly participate in the thread pool. This fixes performance problems when running complex pipelines inside branches. Note that this causes the output of the `if` operator to be unordered between its branches.

Literal values of type `time` in expressions failed to parse when they used subsecond prevision or a time-zone offset. This no longer happens.
