This is a [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) repository that hosts the
documentation for Tenzir (https://tenzir.com).

## Project Architecture

- Use `pnpm` for package management: `pnpm dev` starts a development server,
  `pnpm build` builds the site, and `pnpm preview` previews the built site.
- Prefer [Markdoc](https://markdoc.dev/) for writing documentation over MDX
  where possible.

## Workflow

- Use `gh` to create a pull request, but make sure to write a separate file for
  the PR body to avoid escaping issues.
- Use git commit messages that follow our contribution guide. Details are in
  /src/content/docs/guides/contribution/workflow.

## Formatting

- Every file must end with a newline character, but avoid empty lines at the end of a file.
- Avoid empty lines within functions.
- There exist CI jobs for linting, testing, and deploying the site in
  `.github/workflows`. For Markdown, format and lint with
  [markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint). For JavaScript and
  Typescript, use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for formatting and
  [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting.

## Best Practices

- Always test your changes locally before issuing a commit. This typically means
  building the site and checking the generated HTML output that the change is
  working as expected.
