### `merge = bool (optional)`

Merges all incoming events into a single schema\* that converges over time. This
option is usually the fastest _for reading_ highly heterogeneous data, but can lead
to huge schemas filled with nulls and imprecise results. Use with caution.

\*: In selector mode, only events with the same selector are merged.
