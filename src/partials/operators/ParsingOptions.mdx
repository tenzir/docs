### Duplicate Keys

If the parser encounters a duplicate key in an event, it will transparently
upgrade the field to be a list of values instead. If the values are of different
type, conversions to a common type will be attempted, such as to a common number
type. Ultimately values will be stringified if they do not share a common type.

For a simple example, consider this JSON file:
```json title="Example JSON with duplicate key" {2}
{ "key": 7 }
{ "key": 0.0, "key": 1 }
{ "key": 42 }
```
The event with a duplicate key has the respective value upgraded to a list:
```tql {2}
{ key: 7 }
{ key: [0.0, 1.0] }
{ key: 42 }
```

### `merge = bool (optional)`

Merges all incoming events into a single schema\* that converges over time. This
option is usually the fastest _for reading_ highly heterogeneous data, but can lead
to huge schemas filled with nulls and imprecise results. Use with caution.

\*: In selector mode, only events with the same selector are merged.

In merging mode, a repeated key will always overwrite the previous value.
