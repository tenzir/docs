### `watch = bool (optional)`

In addition to processing all existing files, this option keeps the operator
running, watching for new files that also match the given URL. Currently, this
scans the filesystem up to every 10s.

Defaults to `false`.

### `remove = bool (optional)`

Deletes files after they have been read completely.

{props.removeNote && "This also cleans up directory marker objects (zero-byte objects with keys ending in `/`) encountered while globbing. These markers are artifacts from some tools and can accumulate over time, increasing API costs. Removing them does not affect other files."}

Defaults to `false`.

### `rename = string -> string (optional)`

Renames files after they have been read completely. The lambda function receives
the original path as an argument and must return the new path.

If the target path already exists, the operator will overwrite the file.

The operator automatically creates any intermediate directories required for the
target path. If the target path ends with a trailing slash (`/`), the original
filename will be automatically appended to create the final path.

### `path_field = field (optional)`

This makes the operator insert the path to the file where an event originated
from before emitting it.

By default, paths will not be inserted into the outgoing events.

### `max_age = duration (optional)`

Only process files that were modified within the specified duration from the
current time. Files older than this duration will be skipped.

### `{ … } (optional)`

Pipeline to use for parsing the file. By default, this pipeline is derived from
the path of the file, and will not only handle parsing but also decompression if
applicable.
