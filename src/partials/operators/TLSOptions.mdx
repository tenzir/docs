### `tls = record (optional)`

TLS configuration. Provide an empty record (`tls={}`) to enable TLS with
defaults or set fields to customize it.

```tql
{
  skip_peer_verification: bool, // skip certificate verification.
  cacert: string,               // CA bundle to verify peers.
  certfile: string,             // client certificate to present.
  keyfile: string,              // private key for the client certificate.
  min_version: string,          // minimum TLS version (`"1.0"`, `"1.1"`, `"1.2"`, "1.3"`).
  ciphers: string,              // OpenSSL cipher list string.
  client_ca: string,            // CA to validate client certificates.
                                // (only on operators that accept incoming connections)
  require_client_cert,          // require clients to present a certificate.
                                // (only on operators that accept incoming connections)
}
```

Any value not specified in the record will either be picked up from the configuration
or if not configured will not be used by the operator.
