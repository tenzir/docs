### `tls = record (optional)`

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
TLS configuration. Set to `true`, to use the default TLS settings specified in
the configuration file. Set to `false` to disable TLS entirely (not recommended).
Provide a `record` to pass specific TLS settings for this operator.
=======
TLS configuration. Provide an empty record (`tls={}`) to enable TLS with
defaults or set fields to customize it.

```tql

  cacert: string,               // CA bundle to verify peers.
  certfile: string,             // client certificate to present.
  keyfile: string,              // private key for the client certificate.
  min_version: string,          // minimum TLS version (`"1.0"`, `"1.1"`, `"1.2"`, "1.3"`).
  ciphers: string,              // OpenSSL cipher list string.
  client_ca: string,            // CA to validate client certificates.
                                // (only on operators that accept incoming connections)
  require_client_cert,          // require clients to present a certificate.

}
```

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Any value not specified in the record will either be picked up from the configuration
or if not configured will not be used by the operator.
=======

- `skip_peer_verification: bool` — skip certificate verification.
- `cacert: string` — CA bundle to verify peers.
- `certfile: string` — client certificate to present.
- `keyfile: string` — private key for the client certificate.
- `min_version: string` — minimum TLS version (`"1.0"`, `"1.1"`, `"1.2"`,
  `"1.3"`).
- `ciphers: string` — OpenSSL cipher list string.
- `client_ca: string` — CA to validate client certificates (server mode only).
- `require_client_cert: bool` — require clients to present a certificate
  (server mode only).
