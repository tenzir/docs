### `tls = record (optional)`

TLS configuration. Provide an empty record (`tls={}`) to enable TLS with
defaults or set fields to customize it.

```tql
{
  skip_peer_verification: bool, // skip certificate verification.
  cacert: string,               // CA bundle to verify peers.
  certfile: string,             // client certificate to present.
  keyfile: string,              // private key for the client certificate.
  min_version: string,          // minimum TLS version (`"1.0"`, `"1.1"`, `"1.2"`, "1.3"`).
  ciphers: string,              // OpenSSL cipher list string.
  client_ca: string,            // CA to validate client certificates.
  require_client_cert,          // require clients to present a certificate.
}
```

The `client_ca` and `require_client_cert` options are only applied
for operators that accept incoming client connections, and otherwise
ignored.

Any value not specified in the record will either be picked up from the configuration
or if not configured will not be used by the operator.

See the [Node TLS Setup guide](/guides/node-setup/configure-tls) for more details.
