### `method = string (optional)`

One of the following HTTP methods to use when using the client:

- `get`
- `head`
- `post`
- `put`
- `del`
- `connect`
- `options`
- `trace`

Defaults to `get`, or `post` if `body` is specified.

### `body = blob|record|string (optional)`

Body to send with the HTTP request.

If the value is a `record`, then the body is encoded according to the `encode`
option and an appropriate `Content-Type` is set for the request.

### `encode = string (optional)`

Specifies how to encode `record` bodies. Supported values:

- `json`
- `form`

Defaults to `json`.

### `headers = record (optional)`

Record of headers to send with the request.

### `paginate = record -> string | string (optional)`

Controls automatic pagination of HTTP responses.

**Lambda mode**: A lambda expression to evaluate against the result of the
request (optionally parsed by the given pipeline). If the expression evaluation
is successful and non-null, the resulting string is used as the URL for a new
GET request with the same headers.

**Link mode**: The string `"link"` to automatically follow pagination links in
the HTTP `Link` response header per [RFC 8288](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8288).
The operator parses `Link` headers and follows the `rel=next` relation to fetch
the next page. Pagination stops when the response no longer contains a
`rel=next` link.

### `paginate_delay = duration (optional)`

The duration to wait between consecutive pagination requests.

Defaults to `0s`.

### `connection_timeout = duration (optional)`

Timeout for the connection.

Defaults to `5s`.

### `max_retry_count = int (optional)`

The maximum times to retry a failed request. Every request has its own retry
count.

Defaults to `0`.

### `retry_delay = duration (optional)`

The duration to wait between each retry.

Defaults to `1s`.
