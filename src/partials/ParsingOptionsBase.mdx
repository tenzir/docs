### `schema = string (optional)`

Provide the name of a schema to be used by the parser.

If a schema with a matching name is installed, the result will always have all
fields from that schema.

- Fields that are specified in the schema, but did not appear in the input will be null.
- Fields that appear in the input, but not in the schema will also be kept. Use
  `schema_only=true` to reject fields that are not in the schema.

If the given schema does not exist, this option instead assigns the output
schema name only.

The `schema` option is incompatible with the `selector` option.

### `selector = string (optional)`

Designates a field value as schema name with an optional dot-separated prefix.

The string is parsed as `<fieldname>[:<prefix>]`. The `prefix` is optional and
will be prepended to the field value to generate the schema name.

For example, the Suricata EVE JSON format includes a field `event_type` that
contains the event type. Setting the selector to `event_type:suricata` causes an
event with the value `flow` for the field `event_type` to map onto the schema
`suricata.flow`.

The `selector` option is incompatible with the `schema` option.

<SchemaOnlyOption />

If the schema name is obtained via a `selector` and it does not exist, this has
no effect.

This option requires either `schema` or `selector` to be set.

### `unflatten_separator = string (optional)`

A delimiter that, if present in keys, causes values to be treated as values of
nested records.

A popular example of this is the [Zeek JSON](/reference/operators/read_zeek_json)
format. It includes the fields `id.orig_h`, `id.orig_p`, `id.resp_h`, and
`id.resp_p` at the top-level. The data is best modeled as an `id` record with
four nested fields `orig_h`, `orig_p`, `resp_h`, and `resp_p`.

Without an unflatten separator, the data looks like this:

```json title="Without unflattening"
{
  "id.orig_h": "1.1.1.1",
  "id.orig_p": 10,
  "id.resp_h": "1.1.1.2",
  "id.resp_p": 5
}
```

With the unflatten separator set to `.`, Tenzir reads the events like this:

```json title="With 'unflatten'"
{
  "id": {
    "orig_h": "1.1.1.1",
    "orig_p": 10,
    "resp_h": "1.1.1.2",
    "resp_p": 5
  }
}
```
