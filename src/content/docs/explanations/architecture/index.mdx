Tenzir's architecture consists three primary abstractions:

1. [**Pipeline**](/explanations/architecture/pipeline): A sequence of operators responsible for loading,
   parsing, transforming, and routing data. Pipelines are the core mechanism for
   data processing.
2. [**Node**](/explanations/architecture/node): A running process that manages and executes pipelines.
3. [**Platform**](/explanations/architecture/platform): A higher-level management layer that provides
   oversight and control over multiple nodes.

Here's how they relate schematically:

![Pipelines, Nodes, Platform](pipelines-nodes-platform.svg)

When a node starts, it will automatically attempt to connect to the platform,
giving you a seamless way to manage and deploy pipelines through a web interface.
However, using the platform is optionalâ€”pipelines can also be controlled directly
via the node's API with a CRUD-style approach.

The platform, beyond pipeline management, offers user and workspace
administration, authentication support via external identity providers (IdP),
and dashboards that consists of charts.

Tenzir hosts one instance of the platform at
[app.tenzir.com](https://app.tenzir.com), but you can also [deploy the platform
on premises](/guides/platform-setup) in fully air-gapped
environments.
