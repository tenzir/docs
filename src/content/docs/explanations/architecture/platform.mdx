The **platform** provides *fleet management* for [nodes](../node). With an API
and web interface, the platform offers user and workspace administration,
authentication via external identity providers (IdP), and dashboards consisting
of pipeline-powered charts.

There exist three primary entities in the platform:

1. **Users**: Authenticated by an Identity Provider (IdP)
2. **Organizations**: Manage billing/licencse, members, and workspaces
3. **Workspace**: A logical grouping of nodes, secretes, and dashboards.

The diagram below illustrates their relationship.

A user inside an organization is called a **member**. The organization
configures what members have access to what workspaces.

Organizations are not available in the free **Community Edition**. Please see

## Data Model

The following diagram visualizes the platform's data model (yellow) and how the
entities relate to each other with respect to their multiplicities.

![Platform Data Model](platform/platform-data-model.svg)

It's important to note that every node can only be part of a single workspace.
There is no support for "multi-homing" as it would create non-trivial questions
about how to reconcile secrets and permissions from multiple workspaces.
