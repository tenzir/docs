The **platform** is the management plane for [nodes](../node). As an API and web
interface, it offers user and workspace administration, authentication via
external identity providers (IdP), and dashboards consisting of pipeline-powered
charts.

## Data Model

The platform consists of the following logical components:

1. **Organization**: A company, tenant, customer, or company. Organizations have
   users and workspaces.
2. **Workspace**: A grouping of nodes and users. A workspace to belongs to
   exactly one organization.
3. **User**: A person with access to the platform. Every user is part of at
   least one organization.
