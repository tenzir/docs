Operators accept secrets as parameters for sensitive values, such as authentication
tokens, passwords, or even URLs.

:::note[Security Design]
Secrets are designed to protect against _accidentally_ compromising the secret
value.
You should assume that anyone with access to a workspace will be able to obtain
the true value.

## Usage in TQL

You can use secret values only with operators that accept secrets. Operators
generally do not document that they accept a secret, but they will accept
secrets where appropriate.

You have two ways to pass an argument to an operator that expects a secret.
The following examples use the [`to_splunk`](/reference/operators/to_splunk)
operator, which expects a HEC-token for authentication:

- Provide a plain `string` ([Ad-hoc Secret](#ad-hoc-secrets)):

  ```tql
  to_splunk "https://localhost:8088", hec_token="my-plaintext-token"
  ```

  This creates a "secret" containing the string literal `my-plaintext-token`.

- Use the [`secret`](/reference/functions/secret) function ([Managed Secret](#managed-secrets)):

  ```tql
  to_splunk "https://localhost:8088", hec_token=secret("splunk-hec-token")
  ```

  The operator fetches the secret named `splunk-hec-token` to authenticate with
  the Splunk endpoint.

## The `secret` type

Tenzir's [type system](/reference/language/types) includes secrets as a special
type. You can access secrets only with the [`secret`](/reference/functions/secret)
function.

### Internals

A value of type `secret` contains only the secret's name, not the secret value
itself. When a pipeline operator uses a secret, it resolves the name asynchronously.
For ad-hoc secrets created from a string literal, name and value of the secret
are identical, so no lookup occurs.

### Supported Operations

The `secret` type supports only a limited set of operations. Any operation
involving a secret yields a secret.

:::note[Limited Nesting]
You cannot encode or decode the _result_ of a concatenation or a format string.
:::

#### Encoding & Decoding

In general, Tenzir does not assume that a secret is valid UTF-8, although most
operators will make that constraint. Conversely some secret stores may require
your secrets to be UTF-8, while some operators expect a binary secret.

To bridge this gap, you can base64-decode secrets using the
[`decode_base64`](/reference/functions/decode_base64) function and
base64-encode them using the [`encode_base64`](/reference/functions/encode_base64)
function:

```tql
let $binary_secret = secret("my-encoded-secret").decode_base64()
```

#### Concatenation

You can concatenate secrets with other secrets or strings using the `+` operator:

```tql
auth = "Bearer " + secret("my-secret")
url = $base_url + secret("user-name") + ":" + secret("password")
```

#### Format Strings

Secrets can be used in [format strings](/reference/language/expressions#format-strings).
Unlike other types, which create strings with values formatted as-if using the
`string` function, a format string containing a secret yields a secret.

The above concatenations can be written using format strings, like so:

```tql
auth = f"Bearer {secret("my-secret")}"
url = f"{$base_url}{secret("user-name")}:{secret("password")}"
```

A format string will turn secrets nested in a structured value into the string
`"***"`.

#### Turning Secrets into Strings

You cannot turn a secret into a string. Any such attempt will simply produce the
string `"***"`.

#### Python

Since secrets can also be values in a pipeline, they can also be passed _through_
the `python` operator. You must not modify a secret in the python operator.

## Ad-hoc Secrets

**Ad-hoc secrets** are secrets implicitly created from a `string` within TQL.
This happens when you provide a `string` to an operator that expects a `secret`.

Providing plain string values can help when you develop pipelines and do not
want to add the secret to the configuration or a secret store.

This approach is also useful for arguments that you do not consider a secret, so
you don't have to create a managed secret.

However, secrets created from plain `string`s do not enjoy the same security as
managed secrets. Their value appears directly in the TQL pipeline definition, as
well as in the compiled and executed representation. As such, the Tenzir Node
may persist the value.

## Managed Secrets

Managed secrets are identified by their name and can come from the following
sources, in descending precedence:

1. The environment of the Tenzir Node
2. The configuration of the Tenzir Node
3. The Tenzir Platform secret store for the workspace the Tenzir Node belongs to

![Resolution](secret-resolution.svg)

You use a managed secrets value using the [`secret`](/reference/functions/secret).

The Tenzir Node looks up the secret's actual value only when an operator requires
it. It first checks the config, with environment variables taking precedence
over configuration file entries. If the secret is not found there, a request
is made to the Tenzir Platform.

If the value is transferred over any network connection, it additionally be
encrypted using [ECIES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Encryption_Scheme)
with a one-time, per-secret key. The value remains encrypted throughout the
transfer until the final usage site.

A `tenzir` client process can use managed secrets only if it is able to connect
to a Tenzir Node.

### Configuration Secrets

You can specify secrets in the `tenzir.yaml` config file, under the path
`tenzir.secrets`:

```yaml title="tenzir.yaml"
tenzir:
  secrets:
    # Add your secrets here.
    geheim: 1528F9F3-FAFA-45B4-BC3C-B755D0E0D9C2
```

Since you can also set Tenzir's configuration options as environment variables,
you can define secrets in the environment as well. The above secret could also
be defined via the environment variable `TENZIR_SECRETS__GEHEIM`. An environment
variable takes precedence over an equivalent key in the configuration file.

See the [configuration reference](/reference/node/configuration) for more details.

Tenzir hides the `tenzir.secrets` section from the [`config()`](/reference/functions/config)
function.

### Platform Secrets

The Tenzir Platform stores a separate set of secrets for every workspace. All
Tenzir Nodes connected to that workspace can access these secrets.

You can add, update, or delete secrets from a workspace using either the
`tenzir-platform` CLI or the web interface. Read more details in the
[CLI reference](/reference/platform/command-line-interface#manage-secrets).

For example, to add a new secret `geheim`, use the following command:

```sh title="Add value to the Platform's secret store"
tenzir-platform secret add geheim --value=1528F9F3-FAFA-45B4-BC3C-B755D0E0D9C2
```

To manage secrets from the web interface, go to the `Workspace Settings` screen
by clicking the gear icon in the workspace selector:

#### External Secret Stores

You can configure the Tenzir Platform to provide access to secrets stored in an
external secrets store instead of using its internal secret store. This access
is read-only; you cannot write to or delete from an external secrets store at
this time.

Currently, you can configure external secret stores only with the
`tenzir-platform` CLI. To configure an external secret store, use the
`secret store add` subcommand.

```sh title="Add AWS Secrets Manager as external secret store"
tenzir-platform secret store add aws \
  --region='eu-west-1' \
  --assumed-role-arn='arn:aws:iam::1234567890:role/tenzir-platform-secrets-access' \
  --prefix=tenzir/
```

We currently only support [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/)
as an external secret store, with more to come.

To provide access to external secrets for the nodes, you must give the
Tenzir Platform the necessary permissions to read secret values from the
external store.
In the example above, the Tenzir Platform must be able to assume the specified
role, and the role must have permissions to read secrets under the prefix `tenzir/`
from the Secrets Manager instance in the account of the assumed role.

See the [CLI
reference](/reference/platform/command-line-interface#manage-external-secret-stores)
for more details.

## Legacy Model

You can use the configuration option `tenzir.legacy-secret-model` to change the
behavior of the `secret` function so that it returns a `string` instead of a `secret`.

When you use the legacy model, you can only use secrets from the Tenzir Node's
configuration. You cannot use secrets from the Tenzir Platform's secret store.

We do not recommend enabling this option. It exists as a transition option and
will be deprecated and removed in some future version.

## Security Design

We designed secrets to protect against _accidentally_ compromising the secret
value by revealing it in a log file, showing it in a UI element, or committing
it to a code repository as part of a pipeline.

However, anyone with access to a workspace can access secret values if
sufficiently motivated.

For example, you could use a simple HTTP API that echoes requests to extract
secret values:

```tql
from_http "echo.api.com",
  headers = { leaked: secret("key") },
  metadata_field=metadata
select metadata.headers.leaked
```

```tql
{ leaked: "secret-value" }
```

### Secrets in Diagnostics

We take care not to leak managed secrets in our diagnostic messages. However,
numerous of our integrations rely on third party libraries. Those libraries may
produce error messages which are outside of our control, but that we forward to
the user to help understand an issue.

As a remedy for this, an operator censors the values of managed secrets it has
used in all diagnostics. Please note that we only censor an occurrence of the
full value, not parts of it. This means that a third party diagnostic forwarded
to the user may still contain part of a secret value.

:::tip[Use smaller secrets]
Try and keep your managed secrets to the logical unit that is a secret and use
multiple secrets instead of one big one.

For example and S3 URI may contain multiple keys that should be kept as separate
secrets, instead of a single one:

```tql
let $url = f"s3://{secret("access-key")}:{secret("secret-key")}@bucket/path/to/file"
```
