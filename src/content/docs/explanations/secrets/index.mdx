Secrets are accepted by operators for parameters that may be sensitive,
such as authentication tokens, passwords or even URLs.

## Usage in TQL

There are two ways to pass an argument to a operator that expects a secret:

- By providing a plain `string` ([Ad-hod Secret](#ad-hoc-secrets)):

  ```tql
  to_splunk "https://localhost:8088", hec_token="my-plaintext-token"
  ```

- By using the [`secret`](/reference/functions/secret) function
  ([Manged Secret](#managed-secrets)):

  ```tql
  to_splunk "https://localhost:8088", hec_token=secret("splunk-hec-token")
  ```

  This will fetch the value of the secret named `splunk-hec-token`.

Operators generally do not document that they accept a secret, but will accept
secrets where appropriate.

## The `secret` type

Secrets are a special type in Tenzir's [type system](/reference/language/types).
The `secret` type only supports a limited set of operations, all of which yield
`secret`.

### Encoding & Decoding

Secrets can be Base64-decoded using the
[`decode_base64`](/reference/functions/decode_base64) function and
Base64-encoded using the [`encode_base64`](/reference/functions/encode_base64)
function.

```tql
secret("my-secret").decode_base64()
```

### Concatenation

Secrets can be concatenated with other secrets as well as strings using the
`+` operator.

```tql
auth = "Bearer " + secret("my-secret")
url = secret("user-name") + ":" + secret("password")
```

:::note[Limited Nesting]
The *result* of a concatenation can no longer be encoded or decoded.

## Ad-hoc Secrets

**Ad-hoc secrets** are secrets that are created from a `string` directly within
TQL. This happens when you provide a `string` to an operator that expects a
`secret`.

Providing plain string values can be useful when developing pipelines, if you do
not want to add the secret to the configuration or a secret store.

It is also useful for arguments that are not a secret for all users, such as
URLs.

It is important to understand that secrets created from plain `string`s do not
enjoy the same security as managed secrets. Their value is directly available
in the TQL pipeline definition, as well as the compiled and executed
representation. As such, it may be persisted on the node.

## Managed Secrets

The [`secret`](/reference/functions/secret) function retrieves a managed
secret.

**Managed secrets** are looked up in the following order:

1. The environment of the Tenzir Node
2. The configuration of the Tenzir Node
3. The Tenzir Platform secret store for the workspace the Tenzir Node is
   running in

A secret's actual value is only looked up when it is required by the operator
accepting the secret. If the value is looked up over any network connection, it
is additionally encrypted using
[ECIES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Encryption_Scheme) with a
one-time, per secret key. The value stays encrypted through the entire transfer
until the final usage site.

A `tenzir` client process can use the `secret` function only if it has a Tenzir
Node to connect to.

### Configuration Secrets

Secrets can be specified in the `tenzir.yaml` config file, under the path
`tenzir.secrets`.

```yaml
tenzir:
  secrets:
    # Add your secrets there.
    geheim: 1528F9F3-FAFA-45B4-BC3C-B755D0E0D9C2
```

Since Tenzir's configuration options can also be set as environment variables,
this means that secrets can also be defined in the environment. The above
secret could also be defined via the environment variable
`TENZIR_SECRETS__GEHEIM`. An environment variable takes precedence over an
equivalent key in the configuration file.

See the [configuration reference](/reference/configuration) for more details.

Be aware that the `tenzir.secrets` section is hidden from the
[`config()`](/reference/functions/config) function.

### Platform Secrets

The Tenzir Platform stores a separate set of secrets for every workspace.
These secrets are accessible to all Tenzir Nodes connected to that workspace.

Secrets can be added, updated or deleted from a workspace using either the
`tenzir-platform` CLI or the web interface. Read more details in the
[CLI reference](../reference/platform-cli#manage-secrets).

For example, to add a new secret `geheim`, use the following command:

```sh
tenzir-platform secret add geheim --value=1528F9F3-FAFA-45B4-BC3C-B755D0E0D9C2
```

To manage secrets from the web interface, go to the `Workspace Settings` screen
by clicking on the gear icon in the workspace selector.

#### External Secret Stores

Instead of using its internal secret store, the Tenzir Platform can be
configured to provide access to the secrets stored in an external secrets store.
This access is read-only, writing to or deleting from an external
secrets store is currently not supported.

External secret stores can currently only be configured using the
`tenzir-platform` CLI. To configure an external secret store, use the
`secret store add` subcommand.

```sh title="Add AWS Secrets Manager as external secret store"
tenzir-platform secret store add aws \
  --region='eu-west-1' \
  --assumed-role-arn='arn:aws:iam::1234567890:role/tenzir-platform-secrets-access' \
  --prefix=tenzir/
```

At the moment, only [AWS Secrets
Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/) is supported as external
secrets store.

In order to provide access the external secrets to the nodes, the Tenzir
Platform must be given the necessary permissions to read secret values from the
external store. In the example above, this means that the Tenzir Platform must
be able to assume the specified role, and the role must have permissions to
read secrets under the prefix `tenzir/` from the Secrets Manager instance in
the account of the assumed role.

See the
[CLI reference](/reference/platform-cli#manage-external-secret-stores) for
more details.

## Legacy Model

The configuration option `tenzir.legacy-secret-model` can be used to change the
behavior of the `secret` function to return a `string` instead of a `secret`.

When using the legacy model, only secrets from the Tenzir Node's configuration
can be used, no secrets from the Tenzir Platform's secret store will be
available.

We do not recommend enabling this option.
