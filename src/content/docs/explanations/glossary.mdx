## App

Web user interface to access [platform](#platform) at
[app.tenzir.com](https://app.tenzir.com).

The app is a web application that partially runs in the user's browser. It is
written in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/).

## Catalog

Maintains [partition](#partition) ownership and metadata.

The catalog is a component in the [node](#node) that owns the
[partitions](#partition), keeps metadata about them, and maintains a set of
sparse secondary indexes to identify relevant partitions for a given query. It
offers a transactional interface for adding and removing partitions.

## Connector

Manages chunks of raw bytes by interacting with a resource.

A connector is either a _loader_ that acquires bytes from a resource, or a
_saver_ that sends bytes to a resource. Loaders are implemented as ordinary
[operators](/reference/operators) prefixed with `load_*` while savers are
prefixed with `save_*`.

## Context

A stateful object used for in-band enrichment.

Contexts come in various types, such as a lookup table, Bloom filter, and GeoIP
database. They live inside a node and you can enrich with them in other
pipelines.

- Read more about [enrichment](/explanations/enrichment)

## Destination

An pipeline ending with an [output](#output) operator preceded by a
[`subscribe`](/reference/operators/subscribe) input operator.

- Learn more about [pipelines](/explanations/pipeline)

## Edge Storage

The indexed storage that pipelines can use at the [node](#node). Every node has
a light-weight storage engine for importing and exporting events. You must mount
the storage into the node such that it can be used from [pipelines](#pipeline)
using the [`import`](/reference/operators/import) and
[`export`](/reference/operators/export) [operators](#operator). The storage
cengine comes with a [catalog](#catalog) that tracks [partitions](#partition)
and keeps sparse [indexes](#index) to accelerate historical queries.

- [Ingest data into the node's edge
  storage](/guides/edge-storage/import-into-a-node)
- [Query the node's edge storage](/guides/edge-storage/export-from-a-node)

## Event

A record of typed data. Think of events as JSON objects, but with a richer [type
system](/reference/types) that also has timestamps, durations, IP
addresses, and more. Events have fields and can contain numerous shapes that
describe its types (= the [schema](#schema)).

- Learn more about [pipelines](/explanations/pipeline)

## Format

Translates between bytes and events.

A format is either supported by a _parser_ that converts bytes to events, or a
_printer_ that converts events to bytes. Example formats are JSON, CEF, or PCAP.

- See available [operators for parsing](/reference/operators#parsing)
- See available [operators for printing](/reference/operators#printing)
- See available [functions for parsing](/reference/functions#parsing)
- See available [functions for printing](/reference/functions#printing)

## Function

Computes something over a value in an [event](#event). Unlike operators that
work on streams of events, functions can only act on single values.

- See available [functions](/reference/functions)

## Index

Optional data structures for accelerating queries involving the node's [edge
storage](#edge-storage).

Tenzir featres in-memory _sparse_ indexes that point to [partitions](#partition).

- [Configure the catalog](/guides/node-setup/tune-performance#configure-the-catalog)

## Input

An [operator](#operator) that only producing data, without consuming anything.

- Learn more about [pipelines](/explanations/pipeline)

## Integration

A set of pipelines to integrate with a third-party product.

An integration describes use cases in combination with a specific product or
tool. Based on the depth of the configuration, this may require configuration on
either end.

- List of [all integrations](/integrations)
- [Does Tenzir have an integration for _X_?](/explanations/faqs#do-you-have-an-integration-for-x)

## Library

A collection of [packages](#package).

Our community library is [freely available at
GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/library).

## Loader

A connector that acquires bytes.

A loader is the dual to a [saver](#saver). It has a no input and only performs a
side effect that acquires bytes. Use a loader implicitly with the
[`from`](/reference/operators/from) operator or explicitly with the `load_*`
operators.

- Learn more about [pipelines](/explanations/pipeline)

## Node

A host for [pipelines](#pipeline) and storage reachable over the network.

The `tenzir-node` binary starts a node in a dedicated server process that
listens on TCP port 5158.

- [Deploy a node](/guides/node-setup/provision-a-node)
- Use the [REST API](/reference/node/api) to manage a node
- [Import into a node](/guides/edge-storage/import-into-a-node)
- [Export from a node](/guides/edge-storage/export-from-a-node)

## Metrics

Runtime statistics about the node and pipeline execution.

- [Collect metrics](/guides/analytics/collect-metrics)

## OCSF

The [Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF)](https://schema.ocsf.io) is a
cross-vendor schema for security event data. Our [community library](#library)
contains packages that map data sources to OCSF.

- [Map data to OCSF](/tutorials/map-data-to-ocsf)

## Operator

The building block of a [pipeline](#pipeline).

An operator is an [input](#input), a [transformation](#transformation), or
an [output](#output).

- See all available [operators](/reference/operators)

## Output

An [operator](#operator) consuming data, without producing anything.

- Learn more about [pipelines](/explanations/pipeline)

## PaC

The acronym PaC stands for _Pipelines as Code_. It is meant as an adaptation of
[Infrastructure as Code
(IaC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) with pipelines
represent the (data) infrastructure that is provisioning as code.

- Learn how to provision [piplines as
  code](/guides/basic-usage/run-pipelines#as-code).

## Package

A collection of [pipelines](#pipeline) and [contexts](#context).

- Read more about [packages](/explanations/packages)
- [Learn how to write a package](/tutorials/write-a-package)

## Parser

A bytes-to-events operator.

A parser is the dual to a [printer](#printer). You use a parser implicitly in
the [`from`](/reference/operators/from) operator, or via the `read_*`
operators. There exist also [functions](#function) for applying parsers to
string values.

- Learn more about [pipelines](/explanations/pipeline)
- See available [operators for parsing](/reference/operators#parsing)
- See available [functions for parsing](/reference/functions#parsing)

## Partition

The horizontal scaling unit of the storage attached to a [node](#node).

A partition contains the raw data and optionally a set of indexes. Supported
formats are [Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org) or
[Feather](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/feather.html).

## Pipeline

Combines a set of [operators](#operator) into a dataflow graph.

- [Run a pipeline](/guides/basic-usage/run-pipelines)

## Platform

The control plane for nodes and pipelines, accessible at
[app.tenzir.com](https://app.tenzir.com).

- Understand the [Tenzir architecture](/explanations/deployment)

## Printer

An events-to-bytes operator.

A [format](#format) that translates events into bytes.

A printer is the dual to a [parser](#parser). Use a parser implicitly in the
[`to`](/reference/operators/to) operator.

- Learn more about [pipelines](/explanations/pipeline)
- See available [operators for printing](/reference/operators#printing)
- See available [functions for printing](/reference/functions#printing)

## Saver

A [connector](#connector) that emits bytes.

A saver is the dual to a [loader](#loader). It has a no output and only performs
a side effect that emits bytes. Use a saver implicitly with the
[`to`](/reference/operators/to) operator or explicitly with the `save_*`
operators.

- Learn more about [pipelines](/explanations/pipeline)

## Schema

A top-level record type of an event.

- [Show available schemas in the edge
  storage](/guides/edge-storage/show-available-schemas)

[`publish`](/reference/operators/publish) output operator.

- Learn more about [pipelines](/explanations/pipeline)

## TQL

An acronym for _Tenzir Query Language_.

TQL is the language in which users write [pipelines](#pipeline).

- Learn more about the [language](/explanations/language)

## Transformation

An [operator](#operator) consuming both input and producing output.
