title: Configuration
---

There exist multiple options to configure the behavior of the Tenzir pipeline
executor (`tenzir`) and Tenzir Node (`tenzir-node`) that ship with a Tenzir
package:

1. Command-line arguments
2. Environment variables
3. Configuration files
4. Compile-time defaults

The options are sorted by precedence, i.e., command-line arguments override
environment variables, which override configuration file settings. Compile-time
defaults can only be changed by rebuilding Tenzir from source.

Let's discuss the first three options in more detail.

## Command Line Arguments

The command line arguments of the executables have the following synopsis:

```
tenzir [opts] <pipeline>
tenzir-node [opts]
```

We have both long `--long=X` and short `-s X` options. Boolean options do not
require explicit specification of a value, and it suffices to write `--long` and
`-s` to set an option to true.

## Environment Variables

You can use environment variables as an alternative method to passing command
line options. This comes in handy when working with non-interactive deployments
where the command line is hard-coded, such as in Docker containers.

An environment variable has the form `KEY=VALUE`, and we describe the format of
`KEY` and `VALUE` below. Tenzir processes only environment variables that have
the form `TENZIR_{KEY}=VALUE`. For example, `TENZIR_ENDPOINT=1.2.3.4` translates
to the command line option `--endpoint=1.2.3.4` and YAML configuration
`tenzir.endpoint: 1.2.3.4`.

### Keys

There exists a one-to-one mapping from configuration file keys to environment
variable names. Here are two examples:

- `tenzir.import.batch-size` 👈 configuration file key
- `TENZIR_IMPORT__BATCH_SIZE` 👈 environment variable

A hierarchical key of the form `tenzir.x.y.z` maps to the environment variable
`TENZIR_X__Y__Z`. More generally, the `KEY` in `TENZIR_{KEY}=VALUE` adheres to
the following rules:

1. Double underscores map to the `.` separator of YAML dictionaries.

2. Single underscores `_` map to a `-` in the corresponding configuration file
   key. This is unambiguous because Tenzir does not have any options that
   include a literal underscore.

From the perspective of the command line, setting the `--foo` option via `tenzir
--foo` or `tenzir-node --foo` maps onto the environment variable `TENZIR_FOO`
and the configuration file key `tenzir.foo`. Here are two examples with
identical behavior:

```sh
TENZIR_ENDPOINT=0.0.0.0:42000 tenzir-node
tenzir-node --endpoint=0.0.0.0:42000
```

{% aside type="caution" title="CAF and Plugin Settings" %}
To provide [CAF](https://github.com/actor-framework/actor-framework) and plugin
settings, which have the form `caf.x.y.z` and `plugins.name.x.y.z` in the
configuration file, the environment variable must have the form
`TENZIR_CAF__X__Y__Z` and `TENZIR_PLUGINS__NAME__X__Y__Z` respectively.

The configuration file is an exception in this regard: `tenzir.caf.` and
`tenzir.plugins.` are invalid key prefixes. Instead, CAF and plugin
configuration file keys have the prefixes `caf.` and `plugins.`, i.e., they are
hoisted into the global scope.
{% /aside %}

### Values

While all environment variables are strings on the shell, Tenzir parses them
into a typed value internally. In general, parsing values from the environment
follows the same syntactical rules as command line parsing.

In particular, this applies to lists. For example, `TENZIR_PLUGINS="foo,bar"`
is equivalent to `--plugins=foo,bar`.

Tenzir ignores environment variables with an empty value because the type cannot
be inferred. For example, `TENZIR_PLUGINS=` will not be considered.

## Configuration files

Tenzir's configuration file is in YAML format. On startup, Tenzir attempts to
read configuration files from the following places, in order:

{% steps %}

1. `/opt/tenzir/etc/tenzir/tenzir.yaml` for system-wide configuration, where
   `/opt/tenzir` is the default install prefix and `/etc/tenzir` is the default
   sysconfdir.

2. `~/.config/tenzir/tenzir.yaml` for user-specific configuration. Tenzir
   respects the XDG base directory specification and its environment variables.

3. A path to a configuration file passed via `--config=/path/to/tenzir.yaml`.

{% /steps %}

If there exist configuration files in multiple locations, options from all
configuration files are merged in order, with the latter files receiving a
higher precedence than former ones. For lists, merging means concatenating the
list elements.

{% aside type="tip" title="Example configuration" %}
Check out the [example configuration](/reference/node/configuration) for a fully
documented `tenzir.yaml` that shows all available settings.
{% /aside %}

### Plugin Configuration Files

In addition to `tenzir/tenzir.yaml`, Tenzir loads `tenzir/plugin/<plugin>.yaml`
for plugin-specific configuration for a given plugin named `<plugin>`. The same
rules apply as for the regular configuration file directory lookup.

### Bare Mode

Sometimes, users may wish to run Tenzir without side effects, e.g., when
wrapping Tenzir in their own scripts. Run with `--bare-mode` to disable looking
at all system- and user-specified configuration paths.

## TLS Configuration

Tenzir provides node-level TLS configuration that applies to all operators and
connectors using TLS/HTTPS connections. These settings are used by operators
that make outbound connections (e.g., `to_opensearch`, `to_splunk`, `email`,
`curl`) and those that accept inbound connections (e.g., `load_tcp`, `save_tcp`).

{% aside type="note" title="Use Only When Required" %}
We do not recommend manually configuring TLS settings unless required for
specific compliance or security policies. The default TLS configuration uses
OpenSSL's secure defaults, which are regularly updated and work with most
services. Only override these settings if you have specific requirements.
{% /aside %}

### Minimum TLS Version

You can configure the minimum TLS protocol version to use for all TLS
connections:

```yaml title="<configdir>/tenzir/tenzir.yaml"
tenzir:
  tls:
    min-version: "1.2"
```

Valid values are `"1.0"`, `"1.1"`, `"1.2"`, and `"1.3"`. We recommend using
`"1.2"` or higher for security.

{% aside type="caution" title="TLS 1.0 and 1.1 Deprecated" %}
TLS versions 1.0 and 1.1 are considered deprecated and insecure. Most modern
services no longer support them. Use TLS 1.2 or 1.3 whenever possible.
{% /aside %}

### Cipher Suites

You can specify which cipher suites to use for TLS connections:

```yaml title="<configdir>/tenzir/tenzir.yaml"
tenzir:
  tls:
    ciphers: "ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384"
```

The cipher list format follows OpenSSL cipher list syntax. See the [OpenSSL
documentation](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man1/ciphers.html) for
details on how to construct cipher lists.

### Operators Supporting TLS Configuration

The following operators and connectors automatically respect the node-level TLS
configuration:

- **to_opensearch**: Applies min version and ciphers to HTTPS connections
- **to_splunk**: Applies min version and ciphers to Splunk HEC connections
- **email**: Applies min version and ciphers to SMTP connections
- **curl**: Applies min version and ciphers to HTTP/HTTPS/FTP/FTPS connections
- **load_tcp**: Applies min version and ciphers to TLS server mode
- **save_tcp**: Applies min version and ciphers to TLS client and server modes
- **from_opensearch**: Applies min version to TLS server mode

## Plugins

Tenzir's plugin architecture allows for flexible replacement and enhancement of
functionality at various pre-defined customization points. There exist **dynamic
plugins** that ship as shared libraries and **static plugins** that are compiled
into libtenzir.

### Install plugins

Dynamic plugins are just shared libraries and can be placed at a location of
your choice. We recommend putting them into a single directory and add the path
to the `tenzir.plugin-dirs` configuration option..

Static plugins do not require installation since they are compiled into Tenzir.

### Load plugins

The configuration key `tenzir.plugins` specifies the list of plugins that should
load at startup. The `all` plugin name is reserved. When `all` is specified
Tenzir loads all available plugins in the configured plugin directories. If no
`tenzir.plugins` key is specified, Tenzir will load `all` plugins by default. To
load no plugins at all, specify a `tenzir.plugins` configuration key with no
plugin values, e.g. the configuration file entry `plugins: []` or launch
parameter `--plugins=`.

Since dynamic plugins are shared libraries, they must be loaded first into the
running Tenzir process. At startup, Tenzir looks for the `tenzir.plugins` inside
the `tenzir.plugin-dirs` directories configured in `tenzir.yaml`. For example:

```yaml title="<configdir>/tenzir/tenzir.yaml"
tenzir:
  plugin-dirs:
    - .
    - /opt/foo/lib
  plugins:
    - example
    - /opt/bar/lib/libtenzir-plugin-example.so
```

Before executing plugin code, Tenzir loads the specified plugins via `dlopen(3)`
and attempts to initialize them as plugins. Part of the initialization is
passing configuration options to the plugin. To this end, Tenzir looks for a
YAML dictionary under `plugins.<name>` in the `tenzir.yaml` file. For example:

```yaml title="<configdir>/tenzir/tenzir.yaml"
plugins:
  example:
    option: 42
```

Alternatively, you can specify a `plugin/<plugin>.yaml` file. The example
configurations above and below are equivalent. This makes plugin deployments
easier, as plugins can be installed and uninstalled alongside their respective
configuration.

```yaml title="<configdir>/tenzir/plugin/example.yaml"
option: 42
```

After initialization with the configuration options, the plugin is fully
operational and Tenzir will call its functions at the plugin-specific
customization points.

### Platform TLS Configuration

The platform plugin supports plugin-specific TLS configuration for connections
to the Tenzir Platform. These settings take precedence over the node-level
`tenzir.tls.*` settings, but fall back to them if not specified.

{% aside type="note" title="Use Only When Required" %}
We do not recommend manually configuring TLS settings unless required for
specific compliance or security policies. The default TLS configuration is
secure and compatible with the Tenzir Platform.
{% /aside %}

You can configure these settings in `<configdir>/tenzir/plugin/platform.yaml`:

```yaml title="<configdir>/tenzir/plugin/platform.yaml"
# Minimum TLS protocol version for platform connections
# Valid values: "1.0", "1.1", "1.2", "1.3"
tls-min-version: "1.2"

# OpenSSL cipher list for platform connections
tls-ciphers: "ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256"

# Other platform plugin settings...
# control-endpoint: wss://ws.app.tenzir.com
# skip-peer-verification: false
# cacert: /path/to/ca-bundle.crt
```

These options only affect WebSocket connections from the node to the Tenzir
Platform. If not specified, the plugin falls back to the node-level
`tenzir.tls.min-version` and `tenzir.tls.ciphers` settings.

### List plugins

You can get the list of available plugins using the
[`plugins`](/reference/operators/plugins) operator:

```bash
tenzir 'plugins'
```

### Block plugins

As part of your Tenzir deployment, you can selectively disable plugins by name.
For example, if you do not want the `shell` operator and the `kafka` connector
to be available, set this in your configuration:

```yaml title="<configdir>/tenzir/tenzir.yaml"
tenzir:
  disable-plugins:
    - shell
    - kafka
```
