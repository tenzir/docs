This page explains how packages bundle pipelines, operators, contexts, and
examples into a deployable unit. You'll learn about package design principles
and how the components fit together.

## What is a package

A **package** is a 1-click deployable unit that implements a specific use case.
Packages provide a modular way to distribute TQL functionality, from simple
transformations to complete data processing workflows.

Packages solve common distribution challenges:

- **Reusability**: Share operators and pipelines across teams and projects
- **Configurability**: Template inputs let users customize behavior without
  modifying source files
- **Testability**: The Test Framework validates package behavior
- **Discoverability**: The Tenzir Library makes packages findable and
  installable

## Package structure

import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

A package is a directory with the following structure:

<FileTree>

- pkg/
  - changelog/ User-facing trail of changes
  - examples/ Self-contained snippets to run
  - operators/ User-defined operators (UDOs)
  - pipelines/ Fully deployable pipelines
  - tests/ Integration tests
    - inputs/ Sample data for tests
  - package.yaml Package manifest

</FileTree>

The `package.yaml` manifest is the only required file. It identifies the
directory as a package and contains metadata, context definitions, and input
specifications.

## Package components

### Operators

**User-defined operators (UDOs)** in the `operators` directory provide reusable
building blocks. Tenzir names them using the convention
`<package>::[dirs...]::<basename>`.

Operators can accept [positional and named
arguments](/guides/packages/add-operators#add-parameters-to-operators) for
flexible, parameterized transformations.

### Pipelines

**Pipelines** in the `pipelines` directory are complete, deployable TQL
programs. Unlike operators, pipelines must have both input and output operators.
They run automatically when you install the package (unless disabled).

Pipeline [frontmatter options](/guides/packages/add-pipelines#configure-pipeline-behavior)
control restart behavior, enable/disable state, and other runtime settings.

### Contexts

**Contexts** defined in the manifest provide stateful enrichment capabilities.
The node creates these contexts when you install the package, making them
available for lookup and enrichment operations.

### Examples

**Examples** in the `examples` directory demonstrate how to use the package.
These self-contained snippets appear in the Tenzir Library and help users
understand package capabilities.

### Tests

**Tests** in the `tests` directory validate package behavior using the
Test Framework. Tests ensure operators and pipelines work correctly and provide
confidence during package updates.

### Changelog

The **changelog** directory tracks user-facing changes using the Ship Framework.
It helps users understand what changed between versions and guides upgrade
decisions.

## Design principles

### Composability

Good packages expose **operators** as building blocks that users can compose in
their own pipelines. This maximizes flexibility: users decide when and how to
invoke the functionality.

### Opt-in execution

Packages that include **pipelines** execute immediately upon installation. For
maximum flexibility, ship pipelines with `disabled: true` so users can review
and enable them explicitly.

### Configurability

Use **inputs** to parameterize packages instead of hardcoding values. This
allows the same package to work across different environments without
modification.

### Testability

Write tests for operators and contexts early. The Test Framework makes testing
straightforward, and good test coverage enables confident iteration.

## Package lifecycle

1. **Create**: Set up the package structure and manifest
2. **Develop**: Add operators, pipelines, contexts, and examples
3. **Test**: Validate behavior with the Test Framework
4. **Install**: Deploy locally or through the Tenzir Library
5. **Maintain**: Update the changelog and publish releases
