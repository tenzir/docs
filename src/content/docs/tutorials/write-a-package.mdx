title: Write a package

import { Code, FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This tutorial walks you through building an SSLBL package. Packages bundle
pipelines, operators, contexts, and examples inside a directory that contains a
`package.yaml` manifest. You can [install
packages](/guides/basic-usage/install-a-package) from the [Tenzir
Library](https://app.tenzir.com/library) or deploy them as code.

## Map the use case

In this tutorial, you build a package that detects malicious certificates listed
on the [SSLBL blocklist](https://sslbl.abuse.ch/).

Here is the high-level plan:

1. Extract SHA1 hashes of TLS certificates from network telemetry such as
   [Zeek](https://zeek.org) or [Suricata](https://suricata.io).
2. Compare every hash with a lookup table that mirrors SSLBL data.
3. Emit a detection finding whenever the lookup table contains the hash.

You implement this flow with a [context](/explanations/enrichment) backed by a
table and two pipelines: one that keeps the table synchronized and one that
enriches telemetry.

## Create the package scaffold

Create a directory named `sslbl` and add the standard package layout:

<FileTree>

- sslbl/
  - examples/ Runnable snippets for users
  - operators/ Reusable building blocks for pipelines
  - pipelines/ Deployable pipelines
  - tests/ Integration tests
  - package.yaml Package manifest: metadata, contexts, and inputs

</FileTree>

## Add package metadata

Start by describing the package in
[`package.yaml`](/packages/sslbl/package.yaml) with the following metadata keys:

```yaml title="sslbl/package.yaml"
name: SSLBL
author: Tenzir
author_icon: https://github.com/tenzir.png
package_icon: |
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tenzir/library/main/sslbl/package.svg
description: |
  The [SSLBL](https://sslbl.abuse.ch/) package provides a lookup table with
  SHA1 hashes of blacklisted certificates for TLS monitoring use cases.
```

## Define the context

Next, add a lookup-table context to the manifest. Tenzir creates the context
when you install the package.

```yaml title="sslbl/package.yaml"
contexts:
  sslbl:
    type: lookup-table
    description: |
      A table keyed by SHA1 hashes of SSL certificates on the SSL blocklist.
```

## Keep the context synchronized

To make sure we always have the latest version of the SSLBL data, we create a
pipeline that downloads SSLBL data and updates the context periodically.

We spread this funcionality into two pieces:

1. User-defined operators to fetch the blacklist data and map it to OCSF.
2. A pipeline that periodically updates the context

### Create the user-defined operators

The operator in
[`sslbl/operators/fetch.tql`](/packages/sslbl/operators/fetch.tql) looks as
follows:

import fetchTQL from '/public/packages/sslbl/operators/fetch.tql?raw';

<Code code={fetchTQL} lang="tql" title="operators/fetch.tql" />

The relative path in the packagage defines the operator name. After installing
the package, you can call this operator via `sslbl::fetch`. It will produce
events of this shape:

```tql
{
  timestamp: 2014-05-04T08:09:56Z,
  SHA1: "b08a4939fb88f375a2757eaddc47b1fb8b554439",
  reason: "Shylock C&C",
}
```

Let's create another operator to map this data to [OSINT
objects](https://schema.ocsf.io/1.6.0/objects/osint)—the standardized
representation of an indicators of compromise (IOCs) in OCSF.

import toOsintTql from '/public/packages/sslbl/operators/ocsf/to_osint.tql?raw';

<Code code={toOsintTql} lang="tql" title="operators/ocsf/to_osint.tql" />

This pipeline translates the original feed into this shape:

```tql
{
  confidence: "High",
  confidence_id: 3,
  created_time: 2014-05-04T08:09:56Z,
  malware: [
    {
      classification_ids: [
        3,
      ],
      classifications: [
        "Bot",
      ],
      name: "Shylock",
    },
  ],
  value: "b08a4939fb88f375a2757eaddc47b1fb8b554439",
  type: "Hash",
  type_id: 4,
}
```

:::note[OCSF Verbosity]
You may notice that this shape is a lot more verbose than the original event.
Don't worry, it is absolutely normal when upgrading your raw data to a
semantically richer representation like OCSF. You can always trim the feed down
again later, either automatically with our
[`ocsf::trim`](/reference/operators/ocsf/trim) operator or manually by
[`drop`](/reference/operators/drop)ping fields. But while the data
is in motion, the additional semantics unlock generic analytics when the context
of the original source is long gone.
:::

We can now chain the operators:

But we're not done yet! Let's create one final operator that wraps a single
fetch into an OCSF event that describes a single collection of IoCs: the [OSINT
Inventory Info](https://schema.ocsf.io/1.6.0/classes/osint_inventory_info)
event.

import toOsintInventoryInfoTql from '/public/packages/sslbl/operators/ocsf/to_osint_inventory_info.tql?raw';

<Code code={toOsintInventoryInfoTql} lang="tql" title="operators/ocsf/to_osint_inventory_info.tql" />

We can now call all three operators in one shot to construct an OCSF event:

```tql
sslbl::fetch
sslbl::ocsf::to_osint
sslbl::ocsf::to_osint_inventory_info
```

Now that we have building blocks, let's combine them into something meaningful.

### Periodically fetch the blacklist

The `sslbl::fetch` operator just downloads the blacklist entries once. But the
remote data source changes periodically, and we want to always work with the
latest version. So we turn the one-shot download into a continuous data feed
using the [`every`](/reference/operators/every) operator:

```tql title="sslbl/pipelines/publish-as-ocsf.tql"
every 1h {
  sslbl::fetch
}
sslbl::ocsf::to_osint
sslbl::ocsf::to_osint_inventory_info
publish "ocsf"
```

This is a closed pipeline, meaning, it has an input operator
([`every`](/reference/operators/every)) and an output operator
([`publish`](/reference/operators/publish)). The pipeline produces a new OCSF
Inventory Info event every hour and publishes it to the `ocsf` topic so that
other pipelines in the same node can consume it.

Instead of publishing the data as OCSF events, we can also write another
pipelines that directly updates the lookup table from the plain OSINT objects:

```tql title="sslbl/pipelines/update-lookup-table.tql"
every 1h {
  sslbl::fetch
}
sslbl::ocsf::to_osint
context::update "sslbl", key=value
```

Thanks to our user-defined operators, implementing different use cases now
becomes quite convenient.

## Add examples

To illustrate how others can use the package, we encourage package authors to
add a few TQL snippets to the `examples` directory in the package.

### Example 1: One-shot lookup table update

Here's a snippet that perform a single fetch followed by an update of the lookup
table:

import oneShotUpdateTql from '/public/packages/sslbl/examples/one-shot-update.tql?raw';

<Code code={oneShotUpdateTql} lang="tql" title="examples/one-shot-update.tql" />

### Example 2: Enrich with the context

What do we do with feed of SHA1 hashes that correspond to bad certificates? One
natural use case is to look at TLS traffic and compare these values with the
SHA1 hashes in the feed.

Here's a pipeline for this:

import enrichNetworkActivityTql from '/public/packages/sslbl/examples/enrich-network-activity.tql?raw';

<Code code={enrichNetworkActivityTql} lang="tql" title="examples/enrich-network-activity.tql" />

This pipelines hones in on OCSF Network Activity events (`category_uid == 4`)
that come with a SHA1 TLS certificate fingerprint (`algorithm_id == 2`). If we
have a matche, we add the `osint` profile to the event and publish it to
separate topic `ocsf-osint` for further processing.

### Example 3: Show a summary of the dataset

import topMalwareTQL from '/public/packages/sslbl/examples/top-malware.tql?raw';

<Code code={topMalwareTQL} lang="tql" title="examples/top-malware.tql" />

## Make your package configurable

To make a package more reusable, **inputs** offer a simple templating mechanism
to replace variables with user-provided values.

For example, to replace the hard-coded 1-hour refresh cadence with an input,
replace the value with `{{ inputs.refresh_interval }}` in the above pipeline:

```tql title="sslbl/pipelines/update-as-ocsf.tql"
every {{ inputs.refresh_interval }} {
  sslbl::fetch
}
sslbl::ocsf::to_osint
context::update "sslbl", key=value
```

Then add the input to your `package.yaml`:

```yaml title="sslbl/package.yaml"
inputs:
  refresh_interval:
    name: Time between context updates
    description: |
      How often the pipeline refreshes the SSLBL lookup table.
    default: 1h
```

Users can accept the default or override the value [during
installation](/guides/basic-usage/install-a-package), e.g., when using
[`package::add`](/reference/operators/package/add):

```tql
package::add "/path/to/sslbl", inputs={refresh_interval: 24h}
```

## Test your package

Testing ensures that you always have a working package during development. The
earlier you start, the better!

### Step 1: verify manual installation works

Since our package uses a context, we need a running node. [Spin one
up](http://localhost:4321/guides/node-setup/deploy-a-node/) and then test the
installation:

```tql
package::add "/path/to/sslbl"
```

Confirm that package, pipeline, and context setup correctly:

```tql
package::list
context::list
```

Remove the package again after everything looks good:

```tql
package::remove "sslbl"
```

### Step 2: add tests for your operators

Since our package ships with user-defined operators, we highly recommend to
write tests for them, for the following reasons:

1. You help users gain confidence in the functionality.
2. You provide illustrative input-output pairs.
3. You evolve faster with less regressions.

Yes, writing tests is often boring and cumbersome. But it doesn't have to be
that way! With our purpose-built [test framework](/reference/test-framework) for
the Tenzir ecosystem, it is actually quite fun. 🕺

Let's bootstrap the tests directory:

```sh
mkdir tests
mkdir tests/inputs
```

We'll put a cropped version of https://sslbl.abuse.ch/blacklist/sslblacklist.csv
into `tests/inputs/`:

import sslblacklistCsv from '/public/packages/sslbl/tests/inputs/sslblacklist.csv?raw';

<Code code={sslblacklistCsv} lang="csv" title="tests/inputs/sslblacklist.csv" />

Let's test our first operator, `sslbl::fetch`, by creating a new file in
`tests/`:

import testFetchTql from '/public/packages/sslbl/tests/fetch.tql?raw';

<Code code={testFetchTql} lang="tql" title="tests/fetch.tql" />

Let's watch what it produces by running the test harness in passthrough mode
(`--passthrough` or `-p`):

```sh
uvx tenzir-test --passthrough
```

```
❯ uvx tenzir-test -p
i executing project: sslbl (.)
i running 1 tests (1 jobs) in project .; passthrough
i   1× tenzir (v5.16.0+g741888f304)
i running tests/fetch.tql (runner=tenzir) [passthrough]
{
  timestamp: 2025-10-08T06:32:12Z,
  SHA1: "e8f4490420d0b0fc554d1296a8e9d5c35eb2b36e",
  reason: "Vidar C&C",
}
{
  timestamp: 2025-10-08T06:12:48Z,
  SHA1: "d9b07483491c0748a479308b29c5c754b92d6e06",
  reason: "ACRStealer C&C",
}
...
```

This looks good! Let's update the baseline/reference with this output:

```sh
uvx tenzir-test --update
```

```txt
❯ uvx tenzir-test -u
i executing project: sslbl (.)
i running 1 tests (44 jobs) in project .; update
i   1× tenzir (v5.16.0+g741888f304)
✔ tests/fetch.tql
```

Now observe that there exists a [`fetch.txt`](/packages/sslbl/tests/fetch.txt)
file next to the [`fetch.tql`](/packages/sslbl/tests/fetch.tql) file. The
baseline update create this file and `tenzir-test` will use it for future
comparisons.

Let's test the next operator with a new file:

import testOcsfToOsintTql from '/public/packages/sslbl/tests/ocsf/to_osint.tql?raw';

<Code code={testOcsfToOsintTql} lang="tql" title="tests/ocsf/to_osint.tql" />

Again, watch it first in passthrough mode:

```sh
uvx tenzir-test --passthrough
```

import testOcsfToOsintTxt from '/public/packages/sslbl/tests/ocsf/to_osint.txt?raw';

<Code code={testOcsfToOsintTxt} lang="tql" title="tests/ocsf/to_osint.txt" />

As expected, a valid OCSF OSINT object. Let's make confirm this as our new
baseline:

```sh
uvx tenzir-test --update
```

You can continue to test the remaining operator, or add additional tests for
some examples.

:::note[Test framework package support]
If you paid close attention, you'll notice that we are testing a user-defined
operator here without having to worry about package installation. The test
framework automatically detects the package layout and injects a
`--package-dirs` option to the invocation of the `tenzir` binary.
:::

### Step 3: add a test suite for node interaction

Our package defines a context that lives in a node. Writing tests for such
scenarios is a bit more involved than writing tests for stateless operators. To
test node interactions, we need to use the *suite* concept from the test
framework, which spins up a node fixture and then executes a series of tests
sequentially against that fixture. With that capability, we can finally test the
multi-stage process of updating the context, inspecting it, and using it for an
enrichment.

Defining a suite doesn't take much, just add a `test.yaml` file to a
sub-directory that represents the suite of tests. We'll do this:

<FileTree>

- sslbl/tests/context/
  - 01-context-list.tql
  - 02-context-update.tql
  - 03-context-inspect.tql
  - 04-context-enrich.tql
  - test.yaml

</FileTree>

Here's the test suite definition:

import testYaml from '/public/packages/sslbl/tests/context/test.yaml?raw';

<Code code={testYaml} lang="yaml" title="tests/context/test.yaml" />

Let's take a look at our tests. First, we make sure the context is installed
properly:

import contextList from '/public/packages/sslbl/tests/context/01-context-list.tql?raw';

<Code code={contextList} lang="tql" title="tests/context/01-context-list.tql" />

Then we perform an update:

import contextUpdate from '/public/packages/sslbl/tests/context/02-context-update.tql?raw';

<Code code={contextUpdate} lang="tql" title="tests/context/02-context-update.tql" />

Afterwards we make sure the that the lookup table has the expected values:

import contextInspect from '/public/packages/sslbl/tests/context/03-context-inspect.tql?raw';

<Code code={contextInspect} lang="tql" title="tests/context/03-context-inspect.tql" />
