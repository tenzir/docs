title: Write a package

import { Code, FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This tutorial walks you through building a package for an SSL blacklist.
Packages bundle pipelines, operators, contexts, and examples. You can [install
packages](/guides/basic-usage/install-a-package) from the [Tenzir
Library](https://app.tenzir.com/library) or deploy them as code.

## Map the use case

We'll pick an example from the SecOps space: detect malicious certificates
listed on the [SSLBL blocklist](https://sslbl.abuse.ch/).

This involves three primary actions:

1. Build a lookup table of SHA-1 hashes that mirror SSLBL data.
2. Extract SHA1 hashes of certificates in OCSF Network Activity events and
   compare them against the lookup table.
3. Tag matching events with the OCSF OSINT profile, so that downstream tools can
   escalate the match into an alert or detection finding.

We'll begin with the managing the lookup table. But first we need to get the
package scaffolding in place.

## Create the package scaffold

Create a directory named `sslbl` and add the standard package layout:

<FileTree>

- sslbl/
  - examples/ Runnable snippets for users
  - operators/ Reusable building blocks for pipelines
  - pipelines/ Deployable pipelines
  - tests/ Integration tests
  - package.yaml Manifest: metadata, contexts, and inputs

</FileTree>

## Add the package manifest

The [`package.yaml`](/packages/sslbl/package.yaml) is the **package manifest**.
I contains descriptive metadata, but also the definitions of contexts and
inputs, as we shall see below.

### Add descriptive metadata

```yaml title="sslbl/package.yaml"
name: SSLBL
author: Tenzir
author_icon: https://github.com/tenzir.png
package_icon: |
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tenzir/library/main/sslbl/package.svg
description: |
  The [SSLBL](https://sslbl.abuse.ch/) package provides a lookup table with
  SHA1 hashes of blacklisted certificates for TLS monitoring use cases.
```

### Define the lookup table context

Next, add a lookup table context to the manifest. The node creates the context
when you install the package.

```yaml title="sslbl/package.yaml"
contexts:
  sslbl:
    type: lookup-table
    description: |
      A table keyed by SHA1 hashes of SSL certificates on the SSL blocklist.
```

## Add user-defined operators

Packages give you the ability to implement **user-defined operators** that live
right next to Tenzir's [built-in operators](/reference/operators). These custom
operators are an essential capability to scale your data processing, as you can
break down complex operations into smaller, testable building blocks.

### Create the user-defined operators

First, we create an operator that fetches the latest SSL blocklist from the
[SSLBL](https://sslbl.abuse.ch/) website. The operator in
(/packages/sslbl/operators/fetch.tql) looks as follows:

import fetchTQL from '/public/packages/sslbl/operators/fetch.tql?raw';

<Code code={fetchTQL} lang="tql" title="operators/fetch.tql" />

The relative path in the packagage defines the operator name. After installing
the package, you can call this operator via `sslbl::fetch`. It will produce
events of this shape:

```tql
{
  timestamp: 2014-05-04T08:09:56Z,
  SHA1: "b08a4939fb88f375a2757eaddc47b1fb8b554439",
  reason: "Shylock C&C",
}
```

Let's create another operator to map this data to [OSINT
objects](https://schema.ocsf.io/1.6.0/objects/osint)â€”the standardized
representation of an indicators of compromise (IOCs) in OCSF.

import toOsintTql from '/public/packages/sslbl/operators/ocsf/to_osint.tql?raw';

<Code code={toOsintTql} lang="tql" title="operators/ocsf/to_osint.tql" />

This pipeline translates the original feed into this shape:

```tql
{
  confidence: "High",
  confidence_id: 3,
  created_time: 2014-05-04T08:09:56Z,
  malware: [
    {
      classification_ids: [
        3,
      ],
      classifications: [
        "Bot",
      ],
      name: "Shylock",
    },
  ],
  value: "b08a4939fb88f375a2757eaddc47b1fb8b554439",
  type: "Hash",
  type_id: 4,
}
```

:::note[OCSF Verbosity]
You may notice that this shape is a lot more verbose than the original event.
Don't worry, it is absolutely normal when upgrading your raw data to a
semantically richer representation like OCSF. You can always trim the feed down
again later, either automatically with our
[`ocsf::trim`](/reference/operators/ocsf/trim) operator or manually by
[`drop`](/reference/operators/drop)ping fields. But while the data
is in motion, the additional semantics unlock generic analytics when the context
of the original source is long gone.
:::

We're not done yet. Let's create one final operator that wraps a single fetch
into an OCSF event that describes a single collection of IoCs: the [OSINT
Inventory Info](https://schema.ocsf.io/1.6.0/classes/osint_inventory_info)
event.

import toOsintInventoryInfoTql from '/public/packages/sslbl/operators/ocsf/to_osint_inventory_info.tql?raw';

<Code code={toOsintInventoryInfoTql} lang="tql" title="operators/ocsf/to_osint_inventory_info.tql" />

We can now call all three operators in one shot to construct an OCSF event:

```tql
sslbl::fetch
sslbl::ocsf::to_osint
sslbl::ocsf::to_osint_inventory_info
```

Now that we have building blocks, let's combine them into something meaningful.

:::tip[OCSF Mapping Tutorial]
Mapping data to OCSF can feel like a daunting task. Check out our [dedicated
tutorial OCSF mapping](/tutorials/map-data-to-ocsf) where we cover OCSF at great
length.
:::

## Add deployable pipelines

With our user-defined operators, we get building blocks, but not yet entire
pipelines.

We now create a pipeline that downloads SSLBL data and updates the context
periodically so that we always have the latest version of the SSLBL data for
enrichment.

The `sslbl::fetch` operator just downloads the blacklist entries once. But the
remote data source changes periodically, and we want to always work with the
latest version. So we turn the one-shot download into a continuous data feed
using the [`every`](/reference/operators/every) operator:

```tql title="sslbl/pipelines/publish-as-ocsf.tql"
every 1h {
  sslbl::fetch
}
sslbl::ocsf::to_osint
sslbl::ocsf::to_osint_inventory_info
publish "ocsf"
```

This is a closed pipeline, meaning, it has an input operator
([`every`](/reference/operators/every)) and an output operator
([`publish`](/reference/operators/publish)). The pipeline produces a new OCSF
Inventory Info event every hour and publishes it to the `ocsf` topic so that
other pipelines in the same node can consume it. This is a best-practice design
pattern to expose data that you may reuse multiple times.

But instead of publishing the data as OCSF events and subscribing to it
afterwards, we can directly update the lookup table from the plain OSINT
objects:

```tql title="sslbl/pipelines/update-lookup-table.tql"
every 1h {
  sslbl::fetch
}
sslbl::ocsf::to_osint
context::update "sslbl", key=value
```

Thanks to our user-defined operators, implementing these two different pipelines
doesn't take much effort.

## Add examples

To illustrate how others can use the package, we encourage package authors to
add a few TQL snippets to the `examples` directory in the package.

### Example 1: One-shot lookup table update

Here's a snippet that perform a single fetch followed by an update of the lookup
table:

import oneShotUpdateTql from '/public/packages/sslbl/examples/one-shot-update.tql?raw';

<Code code={oneShotUpdateTql} lang="tql" title="examples/one-shot-update.tql" />

### Example 2: Enrich with the context

What do we do with feed of SHA1 hashes that correspond to bad certificates? One
natural use case is to look at TLS traffic and compare these values with the
SHA1 hashes in the feed.

Here's a pipeline for this:

import enrichNetworkActivityTql from '/public/packages/sslbl/examples/enrich-network-activity.tql?raw';

<Code code={enrichNetworkActivityTql} lang="tql" title="examples/enrich-network-activity.tql" />

This pipelines hones in on OCSF Network Activity events (`category_uid == 4`)
that come with a SHA1 TLS certificate fingerprint (`algorithm_id == 2`). If we
have a matche, we add the `osint` profile to the event and publish it to
separate topic `ocsf-osint` for further processing.

### Example 3: Show a summary of the dataset

import topMalwareTQL from '/public/packages/sslbl/examples/top-malware.tql?raw';

<Code code={topMalwareTQL} lang="tql" title="examples/top-malware.tql" />

## Make your package configurable

To make a package more reusable, **inputs** offer a simple templating mechanism
to replace variables with user-provided values.

For example, to replace the hard-coded 1-hour refresh cadence with an input,
replace the value with `{{ inputs.refresh_interval }}` in the above pipeline:

```tql title="sslbl/pipelines/update-as-ocsf.tql"
every {{ inputs.refresh_interval }} {
  sslbl::fetch
}
sslbl::ocsf::to_osint
context::update "sslbl", key=value
```

Then add the input to your `package.yaml`:

```yaml title="sslbl/package.yaml"
inputs:
  refresh_interval:
    name: Time between context updates
    description: |
      How often the pipeline refreshes the SSLBL lookup table.
    default: 1h
```

Users can accept the default or override the value [during
installation](/guides/basic-usage/install-a-package), e.g., when using
[`package::add`](/reference/operators/package/add):

```tql
package::add "/path/to/sslbl", inputs={refresh_interval: 24h}
```

## Test your package

Testing ensures that you always have a working package during development. The
earlier you start, the better!

### Add tests for your operators

Since our package ships with user-defined operators, we highly recommend to
write tests for them, for the following reasons:

1. You help users gain confidence in the functionality.
2. You provide illustrative input-output pairs.
3. You evolve faster with less regressions.

Yes, writing tests is often boring and cumbersome. But it doesn't have to be
that way! With our purpose-built [test framework](/reference/test-framework) for
the Tenzir ecosystem, it is actually fun. ðŸ•º

Let's bootstrap the `tests` directory:

```sh
mkdir tests
mkdir tests/inputs # files we reference from tests
```

We'll put a trimmed version of https://sslbl.abuse.ch/blacklist/sslblacklist.csv
into `tests/inputs/`:

import sslblacklistCsv from '/public/packages/sslbl/tests/inputs/sslblacklist.csv?raw';

<Code code={sslblacklistCsv} lang="csv" title="tests/inputs/sslblacklist.csv" />

Let's test the operator that maps our input to OCSF OSINT objects:

import testOcsfToOsintTql from '/public/packages/sslbl/tests/ocsf/to_osint.tql?raw';

<Code code={testOcsfToOsintTql} lang="tql" title="tests/ocsf/to_osint.tql" />

We first watch the terminal output it in passthrough mode:

```sh
uvx tenzir-test --passthrough
```

import testOcsfToOsintTxt from '/public/packages/sslbl/tests/ocsf/to_osint.txt?raw';

<Code code={testOcsfToOsintTxt} lang="tql" title="tests/ocsf/to_osint.txt" />

As expected, a valid OCSF OSINT object. Let's make confirm this as our new
baseline:

```sh
uvx tenzir-test --update
```

This created a [`to_osint.txt`](/packages/sslbl/tests/ocsf/to_osint.txt) file
next to the [`to_osint.tql`](/packages/sslbl/tests/ocsf/to_osint.tql) file.
Future runs will use this baseline for comparisons.

Continue to test the remaining operators, or add additional tests for some
examples.

### Test contexts and node interaction

Our package defines a context that lives in a node. Writing tests with nodes is
a bit more involved than writing tests for stateless operators that we can
simply run through the `tenzir` binary.

To test node interactions, we need to use the **suite** concept from the test
framework, which spins up a single fixture and then executes a series of tests
sequentially against that fixture. With that capability, we can finally test the
multi-stage process of updating the context, inspecting it, and using it for an
enrichment.

Defining a suite doesn't take much, just add a `test.yaml` file to a
sub-directory that represents the suite of tests. We'll do this:

<FileTree>

- sslbl/tests/context/
  - 01-context-list.tql
  - 02-context-update.tql
  - 03-context-inspect.tql
  - test.yaml

</FileTree>

Here's the test suite definition:

import testYaml from '/public/packages/sslbl/tests/context/test.yaml?raw';

<Code code={testYaml} lang="yaml" title="tests/context/test.yaml" />

Let's take a look at our tests:

import contextList from '/public/packages/sslbl/tests/context/01-context-list.tql?raw';

<Code code={contextList} lang="tql" title="tests/context/01-context-list.tql" />

Then load our input into the node's lookup table:

import contextUpdate from '/public/packages/sslbl/tests/context/02-context-update.tql?raw';

<Code code={contextUpdate} lang="tql" title="tests/context/02-context-update.tql" />

Finally ensure that the lookup table has the expected values:

import contextInspect from '/public/packages/sslbl/tests/context/03-context-inspect.tql?raw';

<Code code={contextInspect} lang="tql" title="tests/context/03-context-inspect.tql" />

:::note[Automatic package installation]
When the test harness invokes the `tenzir`
(as runner) and `tenzir-node` binary (as fixture), it passes the
`--package-dirs` option in both cases. This ensures that user-defined operators
are available for testing with the runner and contexts in the fixture. When
writing tests, you can simply assume that the package is installed at the node.
