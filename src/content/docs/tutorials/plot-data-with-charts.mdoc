title: Plot Data with Charts
---

In this tutorial you'll learn how you can **use pipelines to plot data as
charts**.

The Tenzir Query Language (TQL) is excellent for slicing and dicing data. But
turning tabular results into actionable insights often requires
**visualization**. This is where charts come into play.

## Available chart types

Tenzir supports four types of charts, each through its own operator:

1. **Pie**: [`chart_pie`](../../reference/operators/chart_pie)
2. **Bar**: [`chart_bar`](../../reference/operators/chart_bar)
3. **Line**: [`chart_line`](../../reference/operators/chart_line)
4. **Area**: [`chart_are`](../../reference/operators/chart_area)

## How to plot data

Plotting data involves the following steps in the Explorer: [Run a
pipeline](../.../guides/usage/basics/run-pipelines) to prepare the data that you
want to plot. Then add a `chart_*` operator to render a plot You can then view
the chart below the Editor.

Once generated, you can **download your plot** or **add it to a dashboard** to
update it periodically.
