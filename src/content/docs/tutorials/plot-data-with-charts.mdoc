title: Plot Data with Charts
---

In this tutorial, you will learn how to **use pipelines to plot data as charts**.

The Tenzir Query Language (TQL) excels at slicing and dicing even the most
complex shapes of data. But turning tabular results into actionable insights
often calls for visualization. This is where charts come into play.

![Charts](./plot-data-with-charts/charts.svg)

## Available chart types

Tenzir supports four types of charts, each with a dedicated operator:

1. **Pie**: [`chart_pie`](/references/operators/chart_pie)
2. **Bar**: [`chart_bar`](/references/operators/chart_bar)
3. **Line**: [`chart_line`](/references/operators/chart_line)
4. **Area**: [`chart_area`](/references/operators/chart_area)

## How to plot data

Plotting data in the Explorer involves three steps:

{% steps %}

1. [Run a pipeline](/guides/usage/basics/run-pipelines) to prepare the
   data.
2. Add a `chart_*` operator to render the plot.
3. View the chart below the Editor.

{% /steps %}

![Pipeline to Chart](./plot-data-with-charts/pipeline-to-chart.svg)

After generating a chart, you can **download it** or **add it to a dashboard**
to make it permanent refresh it periodically.

**Example**: Here's how you generate a pie chart that shows the application
breakdown from Zeek connection logs:

```tql
export
where @name == "zeek.conn"
where service != null
top service
head
chart_pie label=service, value=count
```

### Add a chart to a dashboard

To make a chart permanent:

{% steps %}

1. Click the **Dashboard** button.

   ![Add Chart to Dashboard](./plot-data-with-charts/add-chart-to-dashboard-1.png)

2. Enter a title for the chart, then click **Add to Dashboard**.

   ![Add Chart Title](./plot-data-with-charts/add-chart-to-dashboard-2.png)

3. View the chart in your dashboard.

   ![Chart in Dashboard](./plot-data-with-charts/add-chart-to-dashboard-3.png)

{% /steps %}

🎉 Congratulations! Your chart is now saved and will automatically reload when
you open the dashboard.

### Download a chart

Download a chart in the Explorer as follows:

{% steps %}

1. Click the download button in the top-right corner.

   ![Download Chart](./plot-data-with-charts/download-chart-explorer.png)

## Master essential charting techniques

Now that you know how to create charts, let us explore some common techniques to
enhance your charting skills.

### Plot counters as bar chart

A good use case for bar charts is visualization of counters of categorical
values, because comparing bar heights is an effective way to gain a relative
understanding of the data at hand.

{% steps %}

1. **Shape your data**: Suppose you want to create a bar chart showing the
   outcomes of coin flips. First, generate a few observations:

   ```tql
   from {}
   repeat 20
   set outcome = "heads" if random().round() == 1 else "tails"
   summarize outcome, n=count()
   ```

   Sample output:

   ```tql
   {outcome: "tails", n: 9}
   {outcome: "heads", n: 11}
   ```

2. **Plot the data**: Add the [`chart_bar`](/references/operators/chart_bar)
   operator to visualize the counts.

   Map the outcome and count fields to the x-axis and y-axis:

   ```tql
   from {outcome: "tails", n: 9},
        {outcome: "heads", n: 11}
   chart_bar x=outcome, y=n
   ```

   ![Bar chart](./plot-data-with-charts/chart-bar.png)

{% /steps %}

##### Group and stack bars

Sometimes, your data has a third dimension. You can **group** multiple series
into a single plot.

Example with a `time` dimension:

```tql
from (
  {outcome: "tails", n: 9, time: "Morning"},
  {outcome: "heads", n: 11, time: "Morning"},
  {outcome: "tails", n: 14, time: "Afternoon"},
  {outcome: "heads", n: 15, time: "Afternoon"},
  {outcome: "tails", n: 4, time: "Evening"},
  {outcome: "heads", n: 12, time: "Evening"},
)
chart_bar x=outcome, y=n, group=time
```

![Grouped bar chart](./plot-data-with-charts/chart-bar-grouped.png)

To **stack** the grouped bars, add `position="stacked"`:

```tql
from (
  {outcome: "tails", n: 9, time: "Morning"},
  {outcome: "heads", n: 11, time: "Morning"},
  {outcome: "tails", n: 14, time: "Afternoon"},
  {outcome: "heads", n: 15, time: "Afternoon"},
  {outcome: "tails", n: 4, time: "Evening"},
  {outcome: "heads", n: 12, time: "Evening"},
)
chart_bar x=outcome, y=n, group=time, position="stacked"
```

![Stacked bar chart](./plot-data-with-charts/chart-bar-stacked.png)

#### Scale the y-axis logarithmically

If your data spans several orders of magnitude, **log scaling** can make smaller
values visible.

Example without log scaling:

```tql
from (
  {outcome: "A", n: 3},
  {outcome: "B", n: 5},
  {outcome: "C", n: 10},
  {outcome: "D", n: 21},
  {outcome: "E", n: 10000},
)
chart_bar x=outcome, y=n
```

![Unscaled bar chart](./plot-data-with-charts/chart-bar-nolog.png)

The large value (`E`) dominates the chart, hiding the smaller categories.

Enable log scaling via `y_log=true` to reveal them:

```tql
from (
  {outcome: "A", n: 3},
  {outcome: "B", n: 5},
  {outcome: "C", n: 10},
  {outcome: "D", n: 21},
  {outcome: "E", n: 10000},
)
chart_bar x=outcome, y=n, y_log=true
```

![Log-scaled bar chart](./plot-data-with-charts/chart-bar-log.png)

Now, you can clearly see all the values! 👀

{% aside type="caution" title="Interpreting Log-Scaled Plots" %}
Log scaling removes linearity. Comparing bar heights no longer reflects a simple
numeric ratio. Stacked values are not additive anymore.
{% /aside %}

### Plot compositions as pie chart

Pie charts are well-understood and frequently occur in management dashboards.
Let's plot some synthetic data with the
[`chart_pie`](/references/operators/chart_pie) operator:

```tql
from (
  {category: "A", percentage: 40},
  {category: "B", percentage: 25},
  {category: "C", percentage: 20},
  {category: "D", percentage: 10},
  {category: "E", percentage: 5},
)
chart_pie label=category, value=percentage
```

![Pie chart](./plot-data-with-charts/chart-pie.png)

To provide a consistent user experience across all chart types, `chart_pie`
treats `label` and `x` as interchangeable, as well as `value` and `y`. This
mapping makes intuitive sense when you consider a pie chart as a bar chart
rendered in a radial coordinate system.

{% aside type="note" title="Bar Charts > Pie Charts" %}
**Use bar charts when you can and pie charts when you must**. Why? Pie charts
are often considered inferior to bar charts because they rely on human
perception of angles, which is less accurate than judging lengths, making
comparisons between categories harder. Bar charts allow for quick, precise
comparisons, handle many categories cleanly, and often do not require labels,
while pie charts become cluttered and confusing with numerous slices. Bar charts
also allow easy sorting, are more space-efficient, and tend to stay cleaner
without unnecessary visual distractions like 3D effects. Overall, bar charts
communicate data more clearly, accurately, and efficiently than pie charts.

### Plot metrics as line chart

Line charts come in handy when visualizing data trends over a continuous scale,
such as time series data.

{% steps %}

1. **Shape your data**: For our line chart demo, we'll use some internal node
   metrics provided by the [`metrics`](/references/operators/metrics) operator.
   Let's look at the RAM usage of the node:

   ```tql
   metrics "process"
   drop swap_space, open_fds
   head 3
   ```

   ```
   {timestamp: 2025-04-27T18:16:17.692Z, current_memory_usage: 2363461632, peak_memory_usage: 4021136}
   {timestamp: 2025-04-27T18:16:18.693Z, current_memory_usage: 2366595072, peak_memory_usage: 4021136}
   {timestamp: 2025-04-27T18:16:19.694Z, current_memory_usage: 2385154048, peak_memory_usage: 4021136}
   ```

2. **Plot the data**: Add the
   [`chart_line`](/references/operators/chart_line) operator to visualize
   the time series. We are going to plot the memory usage within the last day:

   ```tql
   metrics "process"
   where timestamp > now() - 1d
   chart_line x=timestamp, y=current_memory_usage
   ```

   ![Line chart](./plot-data-with-charts/chart-line.png)

2. **Aggregate to reduce the resolution**: Plotting metrics with a 1-second
   granularity over the course of a full day can make a line chart very noisy.
   In fact, we have a total of 86,400 samples in our plot. This can make a line
   chart quickly illegible. Let's reduce the noise by aggregating the samples
   into 15-min buckets:

   ```tql
   metrics "process"
   where timestamp > now() - 1d
   set timestamp = timestamp.round(15min)
   summarize timestamp, mem=mean(current_memory_usage)
   chart_line x=timestamp, y=mem
   ```

   ![Line chart with summarize](./plot-data-with-charts/chart-line-summarize.png)

   This looks a lot smoother! **Pro tip**: you can even further [optimize the
   above pipeline](#optimize-plotting-with-inline-expressions) by using
   additional operator arguments.

{% /steps %}

#### Compare multiple series

Our metrics data not only includes the current memory usage but also peak usage.
Comparing the these two in the same chart helps us understand potentially
dangerous spikes. Let's add that second series to the y-axis by upgrading from a
single value to a record that represents the series.

```tql
metrics "process"
where timestamp > now() - 1d
chart_line (
  x=timestamp,
  y={current: mean(current_memory_usage), peak: max(peak_memory_usage * 1Ki)},
  resolution=15min
)
```

![Line chart with multiple series](./plot-data-with-charts/chart-line-multiple.png)

Because `current_memory_usage` comes in gigabytes and `peak_memory_usage` in
megabytes, we cannot compare them directly. Hence we normalized the peak
usage to gigabytes to make them comparable in a single plot.

If you cannot enumerate the series to plot statically in a record, use the
`group` option to specify a field that contains a unique identifier per series.
Here's an example that plots the number of events per pipeline:

```tql
metrics "publish"
chart_line (
  x=timestamp,
  y=sum(events),
  x_min=now()-1d,
  group=pipeline_id,
  resolution=30min,
)
```

### Plot distributions as area chart

Area charts are fantastic for visualizing quantities that accumulate over a
continuous variable, such as time or value ranges. They are similar to line
charts but emphasize the volume underneath the line.

In the above section about line charts, you can exchange every call to
[`chart_line`](/references/operators/chart_line) with
[`chart_area`](/references/operators/chart_area) and will get a working
plot.

```tql
from (
  {time: 1, a: 10, b: 20},
  {time: 2, a: 8, b: 25},
  {time: 3, a: 14, b: 30},
  {time: 4, a: 10, b: 25},
  {time: 5, a: 18, b: 40},
)
chart_area x=time, y={a: a, b: b}
```

![Area chart](./plot-data-with-charts/chart-area.png)

The area under the curve gives you a strong visual impression of the total
event volume over time.

#### Stack multiple series

Like bar charts, area charts can display **stacked series**. This means that the
values of the series add up, helping you *compare contributions* from different
groups while still highlighting the overall cumulative shape.

Pass `position="stacked" to see the difference`:

```tql
from (
  {time: 1, a: 10, b: 20},
  {time: 2, a: 8, b: 25},
  {time: 3, a: 14, b: 30},
  {time: 4, a: 10, b: 25},
  {time: 5, a: 18, b: 40},
)
chart_area x=time, y={a: a, b: b}, position="stacked"
```

![Stacked area chart](./plot-data-with-charts/chart-area-stacked.png)

Notice the difference in the y-axis interpretation:

- Without stacking, the areas *overlap* each other.
- With stacking, the areas become *disjoint* and *cumulatively add up* to the
  total height.

## Optimize Plotting with Inline Expressions

While it's intuitive to *first* prepare your data and *then* start thinking
about how to parameterize your chart operator, this leaves some opportunities
for optimization and better results on the table. That's why the `chart_*`
operators offer additional options for inline filtering, rounding, and
summarization. These options allow you often to immediately jump to charting
without having to think too much about data prepping.

To appreciate these optimization, let's start with our metrics pipeline from the
above line chart example:

```tql
metrics "process"
where timestamp > now() - 1d                         // filtering
set timestamp = timestamp.round(15min)               // rounding
summarize timestamp, mem=mean(current_memory_usage)  // aggregation
chart_line x=timestamp, y=mem
```

![Line chart with summarize](./plot-data-with-charts/chart-line-summarize.png)

You can push the filtering, rounding, and aggregation into the chart operator:

```tql
metrics "process"
chart_line (
  x=timestamp,
  y=mean(current_memory_usage), // aggregation
  resolution=15min,             // rounding (= flooring)
  x_min=now() - 1d,             // filtering
)
```

![Line chart with resolution](./plot-data-with-charts/chart-line-resolution.png)

Note how this make the pipeline more succinct by removing the extra `where`,
`set`, and `summarize` operators.

Here are some important details to remember:

- The `x_min`/`x_max` (also `y_min`/`y_max`) options set the visible axis domain
  to fixed interval. Use these options to crop or expand the viewport.
- When using the `x_min` or `x_max` options, the chart operator implicitly
  filters your data for the correct time range, just as if you had specified
  `where x >= floor(x_min, resolution) and x < ceil(x_max, resolution)`.
  This avoids needing to specify the ranges twice, and makes sure that the
  resolution is taken into account correctly.
- Specifying a duration with `resolution` option creates nicer buckets than
  naïve rounding, as it uses a dynamic floor for the minimum and a ceiling for
  the maximum value in the respective bucket. This results in nicer axis ticks
  that align on the bucket boundary, e.g., hourly or daily.
- The combination of `resolution` with an [aggregation
  function](/references/functions#aggregation) for the `y` series is equivalent
  to the manual `summarize`.
- When you use `resolution`, you can additionally use the `fill` option to patch
  up missing values with a provided value, e.g., `fill=0` replaces otherwise
  empty buckets with a data point in the plot.
