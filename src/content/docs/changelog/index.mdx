Welcome to the Tenzir changelog hub! Here you can find release notes,
feature updates, and behind-the-scenes improvements across our two main
products.

We maintain separate changelogs for each of our offerings to help you stay
up to date with what matters most to you:

1. **Tenzir Node**: the core dataflow engine that powers your pipelines. We
   track all enhancements, bug fixes, and breaking changes in its dedicated
   changelog.

   👉 [View the **Tenzir Node** changelog](./node)

1. **Tenzir Platform**: our centralized control plane and web interface for
   managing your nodes and pipelines. Its changelog covers UI improvements,
   deployment updates, and platform-level capabilities.
