### Bug Fixes

#### Fix configured pipelines causing a crash when they contain a syntax error

Shutting down a node no longer sets managed pipelines to the completed state
unintentionally.

Configured pipelines with retry on error enabled will not trigger an assertion
anymore when they fail to launch.

#### Fix two concurrency issues related to child process creation

We fixed a bug that caused a "Bad file descriptor" error from the python
operator, when multiple instances of it were started simultaneously.
