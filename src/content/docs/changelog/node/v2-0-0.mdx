### Features

#### Clean up transform steps (and native plugins generally)

The `replace` transform step now allows for setting values of complex types,
e.g., lists or records.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2228](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2228).

#### Print segment contents with lsvast

The `lsvast` tool now prints the whole store contents when given a store file as
an argument.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#2247](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2247).

#### Use dedicated partitions for each layout

VAST now creates one active partition per layout, rather than having a single
active partition for all layouts.

The new option `vast.active-partition-timeout` controls the time after which an
active partition is flushed to disk. The timeout may hit before the partition
size reaches `vast.max-partition-size`, allowing for an additional temporal
control for data freshness. The active partition timeout defaults to 1 hour.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#2096](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2096).

#### Allow fine-grained meta index configuration

The new `vast.index` section in the configuration supports adjusting the
false-positive rate of first-stage lookups for individual fields, allowing
users to optimize the time/space trade-off for expensive queries.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#2065](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2065).

#### Add a grand total event counter to the status output

The output of `vast status` now displays the total number of events stored
under the key `index.statistics.events.total`.

By [@6yozo](https://github.com/6yozo) in [#2133](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2133).

#### Backport bug fixes for a v1.1.1 release

The disk monitor has new status entries `blacklist` and `blacklist
  - size` containing information about partitions failed to be erased.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2160](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2160).

#### Support environment variables as alternate config mechanism

VAST has now complete support for passing environment variables as alternate
path to configuration files. Environment variables have *lower* precedence than
CLI arguments and *higher* precedence than config files. Variable names of the
form `VAST_FOO__BAR_BAZ` map to `vast.foo.bar-baz`, i.e., `__` is a record
separator and `_` translates to `-`. This does not apply to the prefix `VAST_`,
which is considered the application identifier. Only variables with non-empty
values are considered.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#2162](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2162).

#### Implement support for transforms that apply to every type and use compaction for aging

VAST v1.0 deprecated the experimental aging feature. Given popular demand we've
decided to un-deprecate it, and to actually implement it on top of the same
building blocks the compaction mechanism uses. This means that it is now fully
working and no longer considered experimental.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#2186](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2186).

### Changes

#### Remove the get subcommand

We removed the experimental `vast get` command. It relied on an internal unique
event ID that was only exposed to the user in debug messages. This removal is a
preparatory step towards a simplification of some of the internal workings of
VAST.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#2121](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2121).

#### Mark `experimental` encoding as `arrow.v2`

VAST's internal data model now completely preserves the nesting of the stored
data when using the `arrow` encoding, and maps the pattern, address,
subnet, and enumeration types onto Arrow extension types rather than using the
underlying representation directly. This change enables use of the `export
arrow` command without needing information about VAST's type system.

Transform steps that add or modify columns now transform the columns
in-place rather than at the end, preserving the nesting structure of the
original data.

The deprecated `msgpack` encoding no longer exists. Data imported using the
`msgpack` encoding can still be accessed, but new data will always use the
`arrow` encoding.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2159](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2159).

#### Minimize the threadpool for client commands

Client commands such as `vast export` or `vast status` now create less threads
at runtime, reducing the risk of hitting system resource limits.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#2193](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2193).

#### Deploy VAST to AWS Lambda

VAST ships experimental Terraform scripts to deploy on AWS Lambda and Fargate.

By [@rdettai](https://github.com/rdettai) in [#2108](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2108).

#### Fix CLI verbosity shorthands

The command line option `--verbosity` has the new name `--console-verbosity`.
This synchronizes the CLI interface with the configuration file that solely
understands the option `vast.console-verbosity`.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#2178](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2178).

#### Remove the "catalog" and "catalog-bytes" keys from the index status

The `index` section in the status output no longer contains the `catalog` and
`catalog-bytes` keys. The information is already present in the top-level
`catalog` section.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#2233](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2233).

#### Rename `meta-index` to `catalog`

The `meta-index` is now called the `catalog`. This affects multiple metrics and
entries in the output of `vast status`, and the configuration option
`vast.meta-index-fp-rate`, which is now called `vast.catalog-fp-rate`.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2128](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2128).

#### Eploit synergies when evaluating many queries at the same time

We revised the query scheduling logic to exploit synergies when multiple
queries run at the same time. In that vein, we updated the related metrics with
more accurate names to reflect the new mechanism. The new keys
`scheduler.partition.materializations`, `scheduler.partition.scheduled`, and
`scheduler.partition.lookups` provide periodic counts of partitions loaded from
disk and scheduled for lookup, and the overall number of queries issued to
partitions, respectively. The keys `query.workers.idle`, and
`query.workers.busy` were renamed to `scheduler.partition.remaining-capacity`,
and `scheduler.partition.current-lookups`. Finally, the key
`scheduler.partition.pending` counts the number of currently pending
partitions. It is still possible to opt-out of the new scheduling algorithm
with the (deprecated) option `--use-legacy-query-scheduler`.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#2117](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2117).

#### Bump the minimum version of Apache Arrow to 7.0

VAST now requires Apache Arrow >= v7.0.0.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#2122](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2122).

#### Clean up transform steps (and native plugins generally)

Multiple transform steps now have new names: `select` is now called `where`,
`delete` is now called `drop`, `project` is now called `put`, and `aggregate` is
now called `summarize`. This breaking change is in preparation for an upcoming
feature that improves the capability of VAST's query language.

The `layout-names` option of the `rename` transform step was renamed `schemas`.
The step now additonally supports renaming `fields`.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2228](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2228).

### Bug Fixes

#### Make man-page creation more robust

The `vast(1)` man-page is no longer empty for VAST distributions with static
binaries.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2190](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2190).

#### Treat list options in env variables consistently

Environment variables for options that specify lists now consistently use
comma-separators and respect escaping with backslashes.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2236](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2236).

#### Reduce the default log queue size for client commands

We optimized the queue size of the logger for commands other than `vast start`.
Client commands now show a significant reduction in memory usage and startup
time.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#2176](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2176).

#### Lift selector field requirements for JSON import

The JSON import no longer rejects non-string selector fields. Instead, it always
uses the textual JSON representation as a selector. E.g., the JSON object
`{id:1,...}` imported via `vast import json --selector=id:mymodule` now matches
the schema named `mymodule.1` rather than erroring because the `id` field is not
a string.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2255](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2255).

#### Correctly terminate the explore command

The `explore` command now properly terminates after the requested number of
results are delivered.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#2120](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2120).

#### Load stores lazily

The `count --estimate` erroneously materialized store files from disk,
resulting in an unneeded performance penalty. VAST now answers approximate
count queries by solely consulting the relevant index files.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2146](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2146).

#### Add support for reals in CSV without dot

The CSV parser no longer fails when encountering integers when floating point
values were expected.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2184](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2184).

#### Fix query pruning in the catalog

The query optimizer incorrectly transformed queries with conjunctions or
disjunctions with several operands testing against the same string value,
leading to missing result. This was rarely an issue in practice before the
introduction of homogenous partitions with the v2.0 release.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#2264](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2264).

#### Don't send null pointers when erasing whole partitions

VAST no longer sometimes crashes when aging or compaction erase whole
partitions.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#2227](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2227).

#### Ignore types unrelated to the configuration in the summarize plugin

Transform steps removing all nested fields from a record leaving only empty
nested records no longer cause VAST to crash.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2258](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2258).

#### Fix race condition with exporter timeouts

Some queries could get stuck when an importer would time out during the meta
index lookup. This race condition no longer exists.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#2167](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2167).

#### Stop accepting new queries after initiating shutdown

VAST servers no longer accept queries after initiating shutdown. This fixes a
potential infinite hang if new queries were coming in faster than VAST was able
to process them.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2215](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2215).

#### Use the timestamp type for inferred event timestamp fields in the Zeek reader

The `import zeek` command now correctly marks the event timestamp using the
`timestamp` type alias for all inferred schemas.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#2155](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2155).
