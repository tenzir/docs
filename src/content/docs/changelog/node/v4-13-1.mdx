### Bug Fixes

#### PRs 4212-satta

The `amqp` connector now properly signals more errors caused, for example, by
networking issues. This enables pipelines using this connector to trigger their
retry behavior.

By [@satta](https://github.com/satta) in [#4212](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4212).

#### Improve `slice` with positive begin and negative end

The `slice` operator no longer waits for all input to arrive when used with a
positive begin and a negative (or missing) end value, which rendered it unusable
with infinite inputs. Instead, the operator now yields results earlier.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4210](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4210).

#### Relax `transform_columns`

The `enrich`, `drop`, `extend`, `replace`, and `deduplicate` operators failed
for empty input events. This no longer happens.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4215](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4215).

#### Remove stream managers when decommissioning partitions

The node's CPU usage increased ever so slightly with every persisted partition,
eventually causing imports and exports to get stuck. This no longer happens.
