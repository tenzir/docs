### Features

#### Support concepts in more places

Concepts are now supported in more places than just the `where` operator: All
operators and concepts that reference fields in events now support them
transparently. For example, it is not possible to enrich with a lookup table
against all source IP addresses defined in the concept `net.src.ip`, or to group
by destination ports across different schemas with the concept `net.dst.port`.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3812](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3812).

#### Implement `timeshift` and `delay` operators

The new `timeshift` operator adjusts timestamps relative to a given start time,
with an optional speedup.

The new `delay` operator delays events relative to a given start time, with an
optional speedup.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3701](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3701).

#### Add GELF parser and document Graylog integration

The new `gelf` parser reads a stream of NULL-byte terminated messages in Graylog
Extended Log Format (GELF).

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#3768](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3768).

#### Update the main repository to include the pipeline manager autostart changes

Pipeline states in the `/pipeline` API will not change upon node shutdown
anymore. When a node restarts afterwards, previously running pipelines will
continue to run while paused pipelines will load in a stopped state.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#3785](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3785).

#### Add node health metrics

A Tenzir node will now automatically collect and store metrics
about disk, cpu and memory usage of the host machine.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#3736](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3736).

#### Add `xsv --no-header`

The  `csv`, `tsv`, `ssv` and `xsv` printers now support not printing a header
line with the `--no-header` option.

By [@eliaskosunen](https://github.com/eliaskosunen) in [#3821](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3821).

#### Add savers for curl connectors

The `http` and `https` loaders now also have savers to send data from a pipeline
to a remote API.

The `http` and `https` connectors have a new flag `--form` to submit the request
body URL-encoded. This also changes the Content-Type header to
`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#3539](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3539).

#### Allow setting the header for csv, tsv, and ssv manually

The  `csv`, `tsv`, `ssv` and `xsv` parsers now support setting the header line
manually with the `--header` option.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3778](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3778).

#### Implement the `diagnostics` operator

The new `diagnostics` operator provides information about diagnostics that a
pipeline may encounter during its lifetime.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#3828](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3828).

#### Fix `export --live` and introduce `metrics`

The `metrics` operator returns internal metrics events generated in a Tenzir
node. Use `metrics --live` to get a feed of metrics as they are being generated.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3790](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3790).

#### Add support for Cisco Firepower syslog messages

The RFC 3164 syslog parser now supports years in the message timestamp.

By [@eliaskosunen](https://github.com/eliaskosunen) in [#3833](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3833).

#### Improve handling of open file descriptors

On Linux systems, the process metrics now have an additional
value `open_fds` showing the number of file descriptors
opened by the node.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#3784](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3784).

#### Implement the `lookup` operator

The new `lookup` operator performs live filtering of the import feed using a
context, and translates context updates into historical queries. This
effectively enables live and retro matching in a single operator.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#3721](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3721).

#### Add time parser

The `time` parser allows parsing datetimes and timestamps from arbitrary
strings using a `strptime`-like format string.

By [@eliaskosunen](https://github.com/eliaskosunen) in [#3738](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3738).

### Changes

#### Switch from JSON to MsgPack data transport

The `fluent-bit` source operator no longer performs JSON conversion from
Fluent Bit prior to processing an event. Instead, it directly processes the
MsgPack data that Fluent Bit uses internally for more robust and quicker event
delivery.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#3770](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3770).

### Bug Fixes

#### Print Zeek TSV metadata when schema changes

The `zeek-tsv` printer incorrectly emitted metadata too frequently. It now only
writes opening and closing tags when it encounters a new schema.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3836](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3836).

#### Optimize pipeline when using `/pipeline/launch`

The `/pipeline/launch` endpoint now optimizes the pipeline before starting it.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#3801](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3801).

#### Fail properly when transfer breaks

Failing transfers using `http(s)` and `ftp(s)` connectors now properly return an
error when the transfer broke. For example, `from http://does.not.exist` no
longer returns silently a success.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#3842](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3842).

#### Fix blob parsing with padding

When reading Base64-encoded JSON strings with the `blob` type, `=` padding is
now accepted.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#3765](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3765).

#### Fix the `tenzir/tenzir:latest-slim` image

The `tenzir/tenzir:latest-slim` Docker image now sets a default
`TENZIR_CACHE_DIRECTORY` automatically.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3764](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3764).

#### Display failing pipeline diagnostics in `/serve`

The `/serve` API now displays why a pipeline became unavailable in an error case
instead of showing a generic error message. This causes runtime errors in
pipelines to show up in the Explorer on app.tenzir.com.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3788](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3788).

#### Fix `export --live` and introduce `metrics`

`export --live` sometimes got stuck, failing to deliver events. This no longer
happens.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3790](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3790).

#### Override lookup-table context entries for duplicate keys

Updating entries of a `lookup-table` context now overrides values with duplicate
keys instead of ignoring them.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3808](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3808).
