### Features

#### PRs 3004-3010

The new `vast exec` command executes a pipeline locally. It takes a single
argument representing a closed pipeline, and immediately executes it. This is
the foundation for a new, pipeline-first VAST, in which most operations are
expressed as pipelines.

### Changes

#### Reduce conflict potential between rebuilding and queries

VAST's rebuilding and compaction features now interfere less with queries. This
patch was also backported as [VAST v2.4.2](https://vast.io/changelog#v242) to
enable a smoother upgrade from to VAST v3.x.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3047](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3047).

#### Add Boost as a dependency

VAST now depends on the Boost C++ libraries.
