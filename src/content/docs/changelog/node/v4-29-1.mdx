### Features

#### Allow assigning ids for pipelines manually

The `/pipeline/create` and `/pipeline/launch` endpoints now accept an optional
`id` parameter for assigning the pipeline's ID manually.

### Bug Fixes

#### Make `drop` not remove empty records

Dropping all fields from a record with the `drop` operator no longer removes the
record itself. For example, `from {x: {y: 0}} | drop x.y` now returns `{x: {}}`
instead of `{}`.

#### Fix crash in the MSB in merging mode

We fixed a bug in the `read_xsv` and `parse_xsv` family of operators and
functions that caused the parser to fail unexpectedly when the data contained
a list (as specified through the list separator) for fields where the provided
`schema` did not expect lists.

#### Fix `tls` option of `to_splunk`

Using the `tls` option of the `to_splunk` operator no longer directly emits an
error.

#### Make UDO resolution order-independent

The resolution of user-defined operator aliases in the `tenzir.operators`
section is no longer order-dependent. Previously, an operator `foo` may have
depended on an operator `bar`, but not the other way around. This limitation no
longer exists.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#5029](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5029).

#### Fix startup delay in `from_fluent_bit`

We fixed a bug that caused pipelines with `from_fluent_bit` to not report their
startup successfully, causing errors when deploying pipelines starting with the
operator through the Tenzir Platform.
