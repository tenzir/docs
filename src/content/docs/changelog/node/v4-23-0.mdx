## Features

### Implement `in` for `list_type`

The relational operator `in` now supports checking for existence of an element
in a list. For example, `where x in ["important", "values"]` is functionally
equivalent to `where x == "important" or x == "values"`.

By [@raxyte](https://github.com/raxyte) in [#4691](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4691).

### Add universal function call syntax

TQL now supports "universal function call syntax," which means that every method
is callable as a function and every function with at least one positional
argument is callable as a method.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#4730](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4730).

### Implement `floor` and `ceil` functions

`ceil` and `floor` join the existing `round` function for rounding numbers,
durations, and timestamps upwards and downwards, respectively.

By [@raxyte](https://github.com/raxyte) in [#4712](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4712).

### Add `load_balance` operator

The new `load_balance` operator distributes events over a set of subpipelines.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#4720](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4720).

### Port kafka connector to TQL2

New `load_kafka` and `save_kafka` operators enable seamless integration with
Apache Kafka in TQL2.

By [@raxyte](https://github.com/raxyte) in [#4725](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4725).

### Add spread syntax `...expr` for lists

The spread syntax `...` can now be used inside lists to expand one list into
another. For example, `[1, ...[2, 3]]` evaluates to `[1, 2, 3]`.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#4729](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4729).

### Expose new hash functions

We've added new hash functions for commonly used algorithms: `hash_md5`,
`hash_sha1`, `hash_sha224`, `hash_sha256`, `hash_sha384`, `hash_sha512`,
`hash_xxh3`.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#4705](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4705).

### Add a `splunk` sink operator

The new `to_splunk` sink operator writes data to Splunk HEC endpoint.

By [@IyeOnline](https://github.com/IyeOnline) in [#4719](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4719).

## Changes

### `splunk` fixes & consistent operator naming

We renamed the TQL2 `azure_log_analytics` operator to `to_azure_log_analytics`.

We renamed the TQL2 `velociraptor` operator to `from_velociraptor`.

By [@IyeOnline](https://github.com/IyeOnline) in [#4726](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4726).

## Bug Fixes

### Correctly handle duplicate serve requests and tune some logs

We eliminated a rare crash in the `serve` operator that was introduced in
v4.20.3.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#4715](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4715).

### Fix TQL2 `summarize` with no groups and no input

TQL2's `summarize` now returns a single event when used with no groups and no
input events just like in TQL1, making `from [] | summarize count=count()`
return `{count: 0}` instead of nothing.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4709](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4709).

### Make `str(enum)` return the name of the enum entry

The `str` function no longer returns the numeric index of an enumeration value.
Instead, the result is now the actual name associated with that value.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#4717](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4717).
