## ✨ Features

### Add support for per-plugin configuration files

Plugins load their respective configuration from
`<configdir>/vast/plugin/<plugin-name>.yaml` in addition to the regular
configuration file at `<configdir>/vast/vast.yaml`. The new plugin-specific file
does not require putting configuration under the key `plugins.<plugin-name>`.
This allows for deploying plugins without needing to touch the
`<configdir>/vast/vast.yaml` configuration file.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1724](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1724).

### Optionally read environment variable for VAST endpoint

It's now possible to configure the VAST endpoint as an environment variable
by setting `VAST_ENDPOINT`. This has higher precedence than setting
`vast.endpoint` in configuration files, but lower precedence than passing
`--endpoint=` on the command-line.

By [@rolandpeelen](https://github.com/rolandpeelen) in [#1714](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1714).

### Rework the plugin loading logic

The options `vast.plugins` and `vast.plugin-dirs` may now be specified on the
command line as well as the configuration. Use the options `--plugins` and
`--plugin-dirs` respectively.

Add the reserved plugin name `bundled` to `vast.plugins` to enable load all
bundled plugins, i.e., static or dynamic plugins built alongside VAST, or use
`--plugins=bundled` on the command line. The reserved plugin name `all` causes
all bundled and external plugins to be loaded, i.e., all shared libraries
matching `libvast-plugin-*` from the configured `vast.plugin-dirs`.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1703](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1703).

### Add option for configurable post-start hooks

The new option `vast.start.commands` allows for specifying an ordered list of
VAST commands that run after successful startup. The effect is the same as first
starting a node, and then using another VAST client to issue commands.  This is
useful for commands that have side effects that cannot be expressed through the
config file, e.g., starting a source inside the VAST server that listens on a
socket or reads packets from a network interface.

## 🔄 Changes

### Rework the plugin loading logic

VAST no longer loads static plugins by default. Generally, VAST now
treats static plugins and bundled dynamic plugins equally, allowing
users to enable or disable static plugins as needed for their
deployments.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1703](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1703).

### PRs 1721-1734

VAST merges lists from configuration files. E.g., running VAST with
`--plugins=some-plugin` and `vast.plugins: [other-plugin]` in the
configuration now results in both `some-plugin` and `other-plugin` being
loaded (sorted by the usual precedence), instead of just `some-plugin`.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1721](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1721).

### Change chat from Gitter to Slack

The VAST community chat moved from Gitter to Slack. [Join
us](http://slack.tenzir.com) in the `#vast` channel for vibrant discussions.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#1696](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1696).

### Remove support for building without Arrow

Apache Arrow is now a required dependency. The previously deprecated build
 option `-DVAST_ENABLE_ARROW=OFF` no longer exists.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1683](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1683).

### Fixup repository-internal symlinks in Dockerfile

The [tenzir/vast](https://hub.docker.com/r/tenzir/vast) Docker image bundles the
PCAP plugin.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1705](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1705).

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Fix log rotation threshold option

The `vast.log-rotation-threshold` option was silently ignored, causing VAST to
always use the default log rotation threshold of 10 MiB. The option works as
expected now.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1709](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1709).

### Fix a bunch of smaller issues

Building plugins against an installed VAST no longer requires manually
specifying `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON`. The option is now correctly enabled by
default for external plugins.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1697](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1697).

### Remove dead condition and fix Docker release tags

Additional tags for the [tenzir/vast](https://hub.docker.com/r/tenzir/vast)
Docker image for the release versions exist, e.g., `tenzir/vast:2021.05.27`.

By [@0snap](https://github.com/0snap) in [#1711](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1711).

### Fix shutdown hang in sources on SIGTERM/SIGINT

Import processes no longer hang on receiving SIGINT or SIGKILL. Instead, they
shut down properly after flushing yet to be processed data.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1718](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1718).

### Make unix dgram metrics sink connectionless

The UDS metrics sink continues to send data when the receiving socket is
recreated.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#1702](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1702).

### Handle arbitrary types in bloom filter synopsis

VAST no longer crashes when querying for string fields with non-string
values. Instead, an error message warns the user about an invalid query.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#1685](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1685).

### Handle quoted strings in CSV parser

The `import csv` command handles quoted fields correctly. Previously, the
quotes were part of the parsed value, and field separators in quoted strings
caused the parser to fail.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1712](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1712).
