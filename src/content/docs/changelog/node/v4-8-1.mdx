### Features

#### Support setting profiles in the Velociraptor config

The `velociraptor` operator gained a new `--profile <profile>` option to support
multiple configured Velociraptor instances. To opt into using profiles, move
your Velociraptor configuration in `<configdir>/tenzir/plugin/velociraptor.yaml`
from `<config>` to `profiles.<profile>.<config>`.

### Bug Fixes

#### Enable the AMQP plugin in the static binary

The `amqp` connector plugin was incorrectly packaged and unavailable in some
build configurations. The plugin is now available in all builds.

Failing to create the virtualenv of the `python` operator caused subsequent uses
of the `python` operator to silently fail. This no longer happens.

The Debian package now depends on `python3-venv`, which is required for the
`python` operator to create its virtualenv.
