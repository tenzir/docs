### Features

#### Add plugin options to enable self-signed platform certificates

The `platform` plugin now understands the `skip-peer-verification`
and `cacert` options in order to enable connections to self-hosted
platform instances with self-signed TLS certificates.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#4918](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4918).

#### Implement `chart_line`, `chart_area`, `chart_bar` and `chart_pie`

Charting functionality is now available in TQL2 via the new `chart_area`,
`chart_bar`, `chart_line` and `chart_pie` operators and the [Tenzir
Platform](https://app.tenzir.com).

By [@raxyte](https://github.com/raxyte) in [#4888](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4888).

#### Implement `unroll` for records

The `unroll` operator now works for record fields as well as lists. The operator
duplicates the surrounding event for every field in the specified record.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4934](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4934).

#### Implement AWS MSK IAM Authentication Mechanism for `{load,save}_kafka`

The `load_kafka` and `save_kafka` operators can now authenticate with AWS MSK
using IAM via the new `aws_iam` options.

By [@raxyte](https://github.com/raxyte) in [#4944](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4944).

#### Add `batches` to input/output operator metrics

`metrics "operator"` now includes a new `batches` field under the `input` and
`output` records that counts how many batches of events or bytes the metric was
generated from.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4962](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4962).

#### Add `tenzir.retention` configuration

The new `tenzir.retention.metrics` and `tenzir.retention.diagnostics`
configuration options configure how long Tenzir Nodes retain metrics and
diagnostics. The policies are checked once every hour.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4949](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4949).

### Changes

#### Deprecate TQL1

TQL1 is now deprecated in favor of TQL2. Starting a TQL1 pipeline issues a
warning on startup nudging towards upgrading to TQL2, which will become the
default in the upcoming Tenzir v5.0 release. This warning cannot be turned off.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4954](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4954).

### Bug Fixes

#### Implement AWS MSK IAM Authentication Mechanism for `{load,save}_kafka`

Operators such as `load_kafka`, `load_s3` etc can now correctly read their
respective YAML configs.
