This release introduces two new powerful OCSF operators that automate enum derivation and provide intelligent field trimming. The update also includes string padding functions, better HTTP requests, IP categorization and much more!

Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/releases/tag/v5.10.0).

### Features

#### Improved node robustness

We added an experimental feature to run node-independent operators of a pipeline
in dedicated subprocesses. This brings improved error resilience and resource
utilization. You can opt-in to this feature with the setting
`tenzir.disable-pipeline-subprocesses: false` in `tenzir.yaml`. We plan to
enable this feature by default in the future.

#### Operations on concatenated secrets

You can now arbitrarily nest operations on secrets. This is useful for APIs that
expect authentication is an encoded blob:

```tql
let $headers = {
  auth: f"{secret("user")}:{secret("password")}".encode_base64()
}
```

#### New string padding functions

Ever tried aligning threat actor names in your incident reports? Or formatting
CVE IDs with consistent spacing for your vulnerability dashboard? We've all been
there, fighting with inconsistent string lengths that make our security tools
output look like alphabet soup. üç≤

Meet your new formatting friends: `pad_start()` and `pad_end()`!

#### Live Threat Feed Dashboard

Create a real-time threat indicator board with perfectly aligned columns:

```tql
from {time: "14:32", actor: "APT29", target: "energy", severity: 9},
     {time: "14:35", actor: "Lazarus", target: "finance", severity: 10},
     {time: "14:41", actor: "APT1", target: "defense", severity: 8}
select threat_line = time + " ‚îÇ " + actor.pad_end(12) + " ‚îÇ " +
                     target.pad_end(10) + " ‚îÇ " + severity.string().pad_start(2, "0")
write_lines
```

```
14:32 ‚îÇ APT29        ‚îÇ energy     ‚îÇ 09
14:35 ‚îÇ Lazarus      ‚îÇ finance    ‚îÇ 10
14:41 ‚îÇ APT1         ‚îÇ defense    ‚îÇ 08
```

#### CVE Priority Matrix

Format CVE IDs and CVSS scores for your vulnerability management system:

```tql
from {cve: "CVE-2024-1337", score: 9.8, vector: "network", status: "üî¥"},
     {cve: "CVE-2024-42", score: 7.2, vector: "local", status: "üü°"},
     {cve: "CVE-2024-31415", score: 5.4, vector: "physical", status: "üü¢"}
select priority = status + " " + cve.pad_end(16) + " [" +
                  score.string().pad_start(4) + "] " + vector.pad_start(10, "¬∑")
write_lines
```

```
üî¥ CVE-2024-1337    [ 9.8] ¬∑¬∑¬∑network
üü° CVE-2024-42      [ 7.2] ¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑local
üü¢ CVE-2024-31415   [ 5.4] ¬∑¬∑physical
```

#### Network Flow Analysis

Build clean firewall logs with aligned source/destination pairs:

```tql
from {src: "10.0.0.5", dst: "8.8.8.8", proto: "DNS", bytes: 234},
     {src: "192.168.1.100", dst: "13.107.42.14", proto: "HTTPS", bytes: 8924},
     {src: "172.16.0.50", dst: "185.199.108.153", proto: "SSH", bytes: 45812}
select flow = src.pad_start(15) + " ‚Üí " + dst.pad_start(15) +
              " [" + proto.pad_end(5) + "] " + bytes.string().pad_start(7) + " B"
write_lines
```

```
       10.0.0.5 ‚Üí         8.8.8.8 [DNS  ]     234 B
  192.168.1.100 ‚Üí    13.107.42.14 [HTTPS]    8924 B
    172.16.0.50 ‚Üí 185.199.108.153 [SSH  ]   45812 B
```

Both padding functions accept three parameters:

- **String to pad** (required)
- **Target length** (required)
- **Padding character** (optional, defaults to space)

If your string is already longer than the target length, it returns unchanged.
Multi-character padding? That's a paddlin' (returns an error).

Your SOC dashboards never looked so clean! üéØ

#### Sinks in HTTP Parsing Pipelines

Parsing pipeline in the `from_http` and `http` operators now support sinks. This
worked already in `from_file` parsing pipelines and now works, as expected, also
in the HTTP parsing pipelines. For example, you can now write:

```tql
from_http "https://cra.circl.lu/opendata/geo-open/mmdb-country-asn/latest.mmdb" {
  context::load "geo-open-country-asn"
}
```

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#5343](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5343).

#### HTTP request body encoding

The `from_http` and `http` operators now support using `record` values for the
request `body` parameter. By default, the record is serialized as JSON. You can
also specify `encode="form"` to send the body as URL-encoded form data. When
using `form` encoding, nested fields are flattened using dot notation (e.g.,
`foo: {bar: "baz"}` => `foo.bar=baz`). This supersedes the `payload` parameter,
which therefore is now deprecated.

###### Examples

By default, setting `body` to a record will JSON-encode it:

```tql
http "https://api.example.com/data", body={foo: "bar", count: 42}
```
```http
POST /data HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 33

{
  "foo": "bar",
  "count": 42
}
```

To change the encoding, you can use the `encode` option:

```tql
http "https://api.example.com/data",
  body={foo: {bar: "baz"}, count: 42},
  encode="form"
```
```http
POST /data HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 20

foo.bar=baz&count=42
```

Arbitrary body contents can be sent by using a string or blob:

```tql
http "https://api.example.com/data", body="hello world!"
```
```http
POST /data HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
Content-Length: 12

hello world!
```

#### IP address categorization functions

Ever wondered if that suspicious traffic is coming from inside the corporate
network? üè¢ We've got you covered with a new suite of IP address classification
functions that make network analysis a breeze.

**`is_private()`** - Quickly spot internal RFC 1918 addresses in your logs.
Perfect for identifying lateral movement or distinguishing between internal and
external threats:

```tql
where src_ip.is_private() and dst_ip.is_global()
// Catch data exfiltration attempts from your internal network
```

**`is_global()`** - Find publicly routable addresses. Essential for tracking
external attackers or monitoring outbound connections:

```tql
where src_ip.is_global() and failed_login_count > 5
// Detect brute force attempts from the internet
```

**`is_multicast()`** - Identify multicast traffic (224.0.0.0/4, ff00::/8).
Great for spotting mDNS, SSDP, and other broadcast protocols that shouldn't
cross network boundaries:

```tql
where dst_ip.is_multicast() and src_ip.is_global()
// Flag suspicious multicast from external sources
```

**`is_link_local()`** - Detect link-local addresses (169.254.0.0/16,
fe80::/10). Useful for identifying misconfigurations or APIPA fallback:

```tql
where server_ip.is_link_local()
// Find services accidentally binding to link-local addresses
```

**`is_loopback()`** - Spot loopback addresses (127.0.0.0/8, ::1). Hunt for
suspicious local connections or tunneled traffic:

```tql
where src_ip != dst_ip and dst_ip.is_loopback()
// Unusual loopback connections might indicate malware
```

**`ip_category()`** - Get the complete classification in one shot. Returns:
"global", "private", "multicast", "link_local", "loopback", "broadcast", or
"unspecified":

```tql
where src_ip.ip_category() == "private" and dst_ip.ip_category() == "multicast"
// Analyze traffic patterns by IP category
```

These functions work seamlessly with both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, making them
future-proof for your dual-stack environments. Happy hunting! üîç

#### `ocsf::trim` and `ocsf::derive`

Tenzir now provides two new operators for processing OCSF events:

**`ocsf::derive`** automatically assigns enum strings from their integer
counterparts and vice versa. It performs bidirectional enum derivation for OCSF
events and validates consistency between existing enum values.

```tql
from {
  activity_id: 1,
  class_uid: 1001,
  metadata: {version: "1.5.0"},
}
ocsf::derive
```

This transforms the event to include the derived `activity_name: "Create"` and
`class_name: "File System Activity"` fields.

**`ocsf::trim`** intelligently removes fields from OCSF events to reduce data
size while preserving essential information. You can also have explicit control
over optional and recommended field removal.

```tql
from {
  class_uid: 3002,
  class_name: "Authentication",
  user: {
    name: "alice",
    display_name: "Alice",
  },
  status: "Success",
}
ocsf::trim
```

This removes non-essential fields like `class_name` and `user.display_name`
while keeping critical information intact.

#### Compression for `write_bitz`

Tenzir's internal wire format, which is accessible through the `read_bitz` and
`write_bitz` operators, now uses Zstd compression internally, resulting in a
significantly smaller output size. This change is backwards-compatible.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#5335](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5335).

### Changes

#### Better query optimization

Previously, queries that used `export` followed by a `where` that used fields
such as `this["field name"]` were not optimized. Now, the same optimizations
apply as with normal fields, improving the performance of such queries.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#5362](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5362).

#### Improved `join` behavior

The `join` function now also works with empty lists that are typed as
`list<null>`. Furthermore, it now emits more helpful warnings.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#5356](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5356).

#### Respecting error responses from Azure Log Analytics

The `to_azure_log_analytics` operator now emits an error when it receives any
response considering an internal error. Those normally indicate configuration
errors and the pipeline will now stop with an error instead of continuing to
send data that will not be received correctly.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#5314](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5314).

#### Renamed `to_asl`

We renamed our Amazon Security Lake integration operator from `to_asl` to
`to_amazon_security_lake`. The old name is now deprecated and will be removed
in the future.

By [@IyeOnline](https://github.com/IyeOnline) in [#5340](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5340).

#### `kv` parser no longer produces empty fields

Our Key-Value parsers (the `read_kv` operator and `parse_kv` function) previously
produced empty values if the `value_split` was not found.

With this change, a "field" missing a `value_split` is considered an extension
of the previous fields value instead:

```tql
from \
  {input: "x=1 y=2 z=3 4 5 a=6"},
this = { ...input.parse_kv() }
```
Previous result:
```tql
{x:1, y:2, z:"3", "4":"", "5":"", a:6}
```
New result:
```tql
{x:1, y:2, z:"3 4 5", a:6}
```

By [@IyeOnline](https://github.com/IyeOnline) in [#5313](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5313).

### Bug Fixes

#### Non-default databases in `to_clickhouse`

The `to_clickhouse` operator erroneously rejected `table` arguments of the form
`database_name.table_name`. This is now fixed, allowing you to write to
non-default databases.

By [@IyeOnline](https://github.com/IyeOnline) in [#5355](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5355).

#### Remove file size limit from Amazon Security Lake Integration

We removed the 256MB file size limit from the Amazon Security Lake integration.

By [@IyeOnline](https://github.com/IyeOnline) in [#5340](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5340).

#### Newlines before `else`

Previously, the `if ‚Ä¶ { ‚Ä¶ } else { ‚Ä¶ }` construct required that there was no
newline before `else`. This restriction is now lifted, which allows placing
`else` at the beginning of the line:

```tql
if x { ‚Ä¶ }
else if y { ‚Ä¶ }
else { ‚Ä¶ }
```

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#5348](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5348).

#### Fixed `encrypt_cryptopan` function

We fixed a bug that sometimes caused the `encrypt_cryptopan` function to fail
with the error "got `ip`, expected `ip`", which was caused by an incorrect type
check. The function now works as expected again.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#5345](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5345).

#### Fixed `list_separator` option name in `print_csv`

The `print_csv`, `print_ssv` and `print_tsv` functions had an option incorrectly
named `field_separator`. Instead, these functions have an option `list_separator`
now, allowing you to change the list separator.
You cannot set a custom `field_separator` on these functions. If you want to
print with custom `field_separator`s, use `print_xsv` instead.

By [@IyeOnline](https://github.com/IyeOnline) in [#5357](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5357).

#### Fix `context::create_geoip` without `db_path`

The `context::create_geoip` operator failed with a `message_mismatch` error when
no `db_path` option was provided. This was caused by an internal serialization
error, which we now fixed. This is the only known place where this error
occurred.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#5342](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5342).

#### Fix `http` operator pagination

The `http` operator dropped all provided HTTP headers after the first request
when performing paginated requests. The operator now preserves the headers for
all requests.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#5332](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5332).
