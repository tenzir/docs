### Features

#### Add a --null option to the lines parser

The `lines` parser can now handle null delimited "lines" with the `--null` flag.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#4603](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4603).

#### Support bytes inputs in the `buffer` operator

The `buffer` operator now works with bytes inputs in addition to the existing
support for events inputs.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4594](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4594).

#### Precise Parsing

The CEF, CSV, GELF, JSON, KV, LEEF, Suricata, Syslog, XSV, YAML and Zeek JSON
parsers now properly adhere to the schema of the read data. Previously, parsers
would merge heterogeneous input into a single, growing schema,
inserting nulls for fields that did not exist in some events.

The `fluent-bit` source now properly adheres to the schema of the read data.

The CEF, CSV, GELF, JSON, KV, LEEF, Suricata, Syslog, XSV, YAML and Zeek JSON
parsers now all support the `--schema`, `--selector` flags to parse their data
according to some given schema, as well as various other flags to more
precisely control their output schema.

By [@IyeOnline](https://github.com/IyeOnline) in [#4527](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4527).

#### Metrics for TCP connections

`metrics tcp` shows metrics for TCP connections, emitted once every second per
connection. The metrics contains the reads and writes on the socket and the
number of bytes transmitted.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#4564](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4564).

#### Dynamically grow simdjson buffer if necessary

The JSON parser is now able to also handle extremely large events when
not using the NDJSON or GELF mode.

By [@IyeOnline](https://github.com/IyeOnline) in [#4590](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4590).

#### Make the kv-parser consider quotes when looking for separators

The `kv` parser now allows for keys and values to be enclosed in double quotes:
Split matches within quotes will not be considered. Quotes will be trimmed of
keys and values. For example `"key"="nested = value, fun"` will now successfully
parse as `{ "key" : "nested = value, fun" }`.

By [@IyeOnline](https://github.com/IyeOnline) in [#4591](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4591).

#### Implement the azure-blob-storage connector

The new `azure-blob-storage` connector allows reading from and writing
to Azure Blob Storage via an URI.

By [@IyeOnline](https://github.com/IyeOnline) in [#4617](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4617).

### Changes

#### Prefer recent partitions for retro lookups

The `lookup` operator now prefers recent data in searches for lookups against
historical data instead of using the order in which context updates arrive.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4636](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4636).

#### Switch the index to basic messaging

We removed the unused `--snapshot` option from the `lookup` operator.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#4613](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4613).

#### Precise Parsing

The JSON parser's `--precise` option is now deprecated, as the "precise" mode
is the new default. Use `--merge` to get the previous "imprecise" behavior.

The JSON parser's `--no-infer` option has been renamed to `--schema-only`. The
old name is deprecated and will be removed in the future.

By [@IyeOnline](https://github.com/IyeOnline) in [#4527](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4527).

#### Stabilize the `bitz` format

Tenzir's internal wire format `bitz` is now considered stable. Note that the
format underwent significant changes as part of its stabilization, and is
incompatible with `bitz` from Tenzir Node v4.20 and older.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4633](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4633).

### Bug Fixes

#### Stabilize the `bitz` format

We fixed a very rare crash in the zero-copy parser implementation of `read
feather` and `read parquet` that was caused by releasing shared memory too
early.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4633](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4633).

#### Keep from tcp pipelines running on connection failures

Pipelines starting with `from tcp` no longer enter the failed state when an
error occurrs in one of the connections.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#4602](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4602).

#### Stop using connection timeout to get node components

The `import` and `partitions` operators and the `tenzir-ctl rebuild` command no
longer occasionally fail with request timeouts when the node is under high load.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4597](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4597).

#### Make `read json --arrays-of-objects` faster

We fixed an accidentally quadratic scaling with the number of top-level array
elements in `read json --arrays-of-objects`. As a result, using this option will
now be much faster.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4601](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4601).

#### Precise Parsing

We fixed various edge cases in parsers where values would not be properly parsed
as typed data and were stored as plain text instead. No input data was lost, but
no valuable type information was gained either.
