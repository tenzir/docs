## Features

### Add a nix package expression for VAST

For users of the [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) package manager, expressions have
been added to generate reproducible development environments with `nix-shell`.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#740](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/740).

## Changes

### Revert "Annotate schemas with

Hash indices have been disabled again due to a performance regression.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#765](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/765).

### Remove default option for historical queries

The option `--historical` for export commands has been removed, as it was the
 default already.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#754](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/754).

### Update VAST for Apache Arrow 0.16

VAST now supports (and requires) Apache Arrow >= 0.16.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#751](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/751).

### Add a nix package expression for VAST

The build system will from now on try use the CAF library from the system, if
one is provided. If it is not found, the CAF submodule will be used as a
fallback.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#740](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/740).

### Allow for separating persistent state and log directories

The option `--directory` has been replaced by `--db-directory` and
`log-directory`, which set directories for persistent state and log files
respectively. The default log file path has changed from `vast.db/log` to
`vast.log`.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#758](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/758).

## Bug Fixes

### Continuous import of Zeek logs in VAST is broken

Continuously importing events from a Zeek process with a low rate of emitted
events resulted in a long delay until the data would be included in the result
set of queries. This is because the import process would buffer up to 10,000
events before sending them to the server as a batch. The algorithm has been
tuned to flush its buffers if no data is available for more than 500
milliseconds.
