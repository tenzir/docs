### Features

#### Add file data to show partitions

`show partitions` now contains location and size of the `store`, `index`, and
`sketch` files of a partition, as well the aggregate size at `diskusage`.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#3675](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3675).

#### Implement the `geoip` context

The new `geoip` context is a built-in that reads MaxMind DB files and uses IP
values in events to enrich them with the MaxMind DB geolocation data.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#3731](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3731).

#### Show processes and sockets

With the new `processes` and `sockets` source operators, you can now get a
snapshot of the operating system processes and sockets as pipeline input.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#3521](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3521).

#### Add `grok` parser

The `grok` parser, for use with the `parse` operator, enables powerful
regex-based string dissection.

By [@eliaskosunen](https://github.com/eliaskosunen) in [#3683](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3683).

#### Add TCP saver

The `tcp` connector is now also a saver in addition to a loader.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#3727](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3727).

#### Add support for macOS-style syslog messages

The `syslog` parser now supports macOS-style syslog messages.

By [@eliaskosunen](https://github.com/eliaskosunen) in [#3692](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3692).

#### Include UDOs in `show operators`

`show operators` now shows user-defined operators in addition to operators
that ship with Tenzir or as plugins.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3723](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3723).

#### Add `kv` parser

The `kv` parser splits strings into key-value pairs.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#3646](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3646).

#### Implement the `slice` operator

The `slice` operator keeps a range of events within a half-closed interval.
Begin and end of the interval can be specified relative to the first or last
event.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3703](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3703).

### Changes

#### Add support for macOS-style syslog messages

The events created by the RFC 3164 syslog parser no longer has a `tag` field,
but `app_name` and `process_id`.

By [@eliaskosunen](https://github.com/eliaskosunen) in [#3692](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3692).

#### Allow empty field names

Records can now have fields where the name is empty.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#3742](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3742).

#### Show processes and sockets

The `show` operator now always connects to and runs at a node. Consequently, the
`version` and `nics` aspects moved into operators of their own.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#3521](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3521).

### Bug Fixes

#### Prevent delays for blocking operators

Pipeline operators blocking in their execution sometimes caused results to be
delayed. This is no longer the case. This bug fix also reduces the time to first
result for pipelines with many operators.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3743](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3743).
