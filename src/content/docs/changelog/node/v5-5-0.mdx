Built-in support for normalizing OCSF events to their upstream schema makes normalizations easier than ever with Tenzir Node v5.5.

Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/releases/tag/v5.5.0).

### Features

#### Entropy Calculation

TQL now supports calculating the Shannon entropy of data using the new `entropy`
aggregation function. This function measures the amount of uncertainty or
randomness in your data, which is particularly useful for analyzing data
distributions and information content.

The entropy function calculates Shannon entropy using the formula `H(x) =
-sum(p(x[i]) \* log(p(x[i])))`, where `p(x[i])` is the probability of each
unique value. Higher entropy values indicate more randomness, while lower values
indicate more predictability in your data.

For example, if you have a dataset with different categories and want to measure
how evenly distributed they are:

```tql
from {category: "A"}, {category: "A"}, {category: "B"}, {category: "C"}
summarize entropy_value = category.entropy()
```

This will return an entropy value of approximately 1.04, indicating moderate
randomness in the distribution.

The function also supports normalization via an optional `normalize` parameter.
When set to `true`, the entropy is normalized between 0 and 1 by dividing by
the logarithm of the number of unique values:

```tql
from {category: "A"}, {category: "A"}, {category: "B"}, {category: "C"}
summarize normalized_entropy = category.entropy(normalize=true)
```

This returns a normalized entropy value of approximately 0.95, making it easier
to compare entropy across datasets with different numbers of unique values.

#### Rename files after reading them

The `from_file` operator now supports moving files after reading them.

For example, `from_file "logs/*.log", rename=path => f"{path}.done"` reads all
`.log` files in the `logs` directory, and after reading them renames the files
to have the extension `.log.done`.

#### Dedicated OCSF operator

The new operator `ocsf::apply` converts events to the OCSF schema, making sure
that all events have the same type. It supports all OCSF versions (including
`-dev` versions), all OCSF classes and all OCSF profiles. The schema to use is
determined by `class_uid`, `metadata.version` and `metadata.profiles` (if it
exists). The operator emits warnings if it finds unexpected fields or mismatched
types. Expect more OCSF-native functionality coming to Tenzir soon!

#### Writing CEF and LEEF

We have added two new functions `print_leef` and `print_cef`. With
these and the already existing `write_syslog`, you are now able to write
nested CEF or LEEF in a syslog frame. In combination with the already existing
ability to read nested CEF and LEEF, this enables you to transparently forward
firewall logs.

For example, you can read in CEF messages, enrich them, and send them out
again:

```tql
// Accept syslog over TCP
load_tcp "127.0.0.1:1234" {
  read_syslog
}
// Parse the nested message as structured CEF data
message = message.parse_cef()
// Enrich the message, if its a high severity message
if message.severity in ["High", "Very High", "7", "8", "9"] {
  context::enrich "my-context",
    key=message.extension.source_ip,
    into=message.extension
}
// Re-write the message as CEF
message = message.extension.print_cef(
  cef_version=message.cef_version,
  device_vendor=message.device_vendor, device_product=message.device_product,
  device_version=message.device_version, signature_id=signature_id,
  severity=message.severity,
  name=r#"enriched via "my-context": "# + message.name
)
// Write as syslog again
write_syslog
// Send the bytestream to some destination
```

### Changes

#### Updated OCSF functions

The functions available under `ocsf::` were updated to fully reflect the newest
OCSF schema. Additionally, the functions `ocsf::type_uid` and `ocsf::type_name`
were added.

### Bug Fixes

#### Fixed panic in `parent_dir`

The `parent_dir` function no longer panics on some inputs.

#### SNI support in `from_http`

The `from_http` operator now correctly sets the domain for TLS SNI (Server Name Indication).

#### CPU limits in containers

Nodes now correctly respect cgroup CPU limits on Linux. Previously, such limits were ignored, and the node always used the physical number of cores available, unless a lower number was explicitly configured through the `caf.scheduler.max-threads` option. This bug fix may improve performance and resource utilization for nodes running in environments with such limitations.

#### Fixed stack traces in Docker images

Backtraces no longer miss function identifiers when running the official Docker images.
