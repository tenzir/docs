Tenzir Node v5.2 brings our most requested feature to life, adding the ability
to watch a local filesystem directory or a blob storage bucket for new files
within a pipeline.

Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/releases/tag/v5.2.0).

### Features

#### Add `from_file` operator

The new `from_file` operator can be used to read multiple files from a
potentially remote filesystem using globbing expressions. It also supports
watching for new files and deletion after a file has been read.

`read_lines` now has an additional `binary=true` option which should be used if
the incoming byte stream is not valid UTF-8.

### Bug Fixes

#### Handle empty files in `read_xsv` & friends

We fixed a bug that caused `read_xsv` & friends to crash when trying to read an
empty file.

#### Fix hang for operators with infinite idle timeout

We fixed a hang in the `cache` and `buffer` operators when their input finished.
This also prevented the node from shutting down cleanly.

#### Fix a crash in `to_clickhouse` and bump `clickhouse-cpp`

We fixed a bug in `to_clickhouse` that caused the operator to crash when
encountering lists.

#### Add `from_file` operator

The `read_lines` operator now validates that the incoming lines are UTF-8.
