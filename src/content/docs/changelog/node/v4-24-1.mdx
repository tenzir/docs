### Bug Fixes

#### Fix `last` aggregation

We fixed the `last` aggregation function to return the last element.

#### Check mmapped chunks for required minimum size

We fixed a bug introduced with v4.24.0 causing crashes on startup when some
of the files in the node's state directory were smaller than 12 bytes.

#### Fix a rare crash in the index actor on startup

We fixed a rare crash on startup that would occur when starting the
`tenzir-node` process was so slow that it would try to emit metrics before the
component handling metrics was ready.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4846](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4846).

#### Fix operator name for TQL2 `nics`

The TQL2 `nics` operator had a bug causing the operator name to be `nic`.
This has now been fixed and works as documented.
