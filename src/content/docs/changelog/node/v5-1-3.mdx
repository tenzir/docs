This release adds support for URL encoding and decoding, and fixes the
handling of user-defined operators in TQL2.

## ✨ Features

### Implement `strict { ... }`

We added a new `strict` operator that takes a pipeline and treats all warnings
emitted by that pipeline as errors, i.e., effectively stopping the pipeline at
the first diagnostic. This is useful when you to ensure want a critical piece of
your pipeline does not continue in unexpected scenarios.

### Add `encode_url` and `decode_url` functions

The `encode_url` and `decode_url` functions encode and decode URLs. For example,
`"Hello%20World".decode_url()` returns `b"Hello World"`.

## 🔄 Changes

### Remove `pipeline::internal_parse()` from `to_azure_log_analytics`

The `table` option of the `to_azure_log_analytics` has been renamed to `stream`
to better reflect the expected value. Additionally, a new option `batch_timeout`
has been added to configure the max duration to wait before finishing a batch.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Fix user-defined operators for TQL2

User-defined operators still required the `// tql2` comment at the start or the
`tenzir.tql2` option to be set, despite TQL2 being the default since Tenzir Node
v5.0. They now work as expected.
