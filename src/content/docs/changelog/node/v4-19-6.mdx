### Features

#### Implement the `assert` operator

The `tenzir` command-line utility gained a new option `--strict`, causing it to
exit with a non-zero exit code for pipelines that emit at least one warning.

### Bug Fixes

#### Fix a potentially uncaught exception in `shell`

We fixed a bug in the `shell` operator that could cause the process to crash
when breaking its pipe. Now, the operator shuts down with an error diagnostic
instead.

Pipelines with the `python` operator now deploy more quickly, as their
deployment no longer waits for the virtual environment to be set up
successfully.

#### Fix `slice 1:-1` for exactly one event

The `slice` operator no longer crashes when used with a positive begin and
negative end value when operating on less events than `-end`, e.g., when working
on a single event and using `slice 0:-1`.
