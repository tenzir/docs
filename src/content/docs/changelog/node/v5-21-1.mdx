This release features new and improved hash functions as well as a couple of bugfixes.

Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/releases/tag/v5.21.1).

### Features

#### OpenSSL hash backend and SHA3 functions

All `hash_*` functions (MD5/SHA1/SHA2) now use OpenSSL's EVP implementation
instead of the previous digestpp copies. We've also added SHA3-224/256/384/512
variants to the `hash_*` family.

Here's how you compute a SHA3 hash digest:

```tql
from {x: hash_sha3_256("foo")}
```

```tql
{x: "76d3bc41c9f588f7fcd0d5bf4718f8f84b1c41b20882703100b9eb9413807c01"}
```

### Bug Fixes

#### Fixed assertion failure in `to_hive`

We addressed an assertion failure in the `to_hive` operator, which could fail
the partitioned writes for some data and format combinations.

#### Fixed `write_parquet`

In the last release we introduced a bug that made the `write_parquet` operator
exit early without writing the file. This has now been fixed.
