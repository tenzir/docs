### Features

#### Allow `/* ... */` comments in the VAST language

The VAST language now supports comments using the familiar `/* comment */`
notation. This makes it easy to document multi-line pipelines inline.

### Bug Fixes

#### Include outdated but not undersized partitions in automatic rebuilds

Automatic partition rebuilding both updates partitions with an outdated storage
format and merges undersized partitions continuously in the background. This now
also works as expected for outdated but not undersized partitions.

#### Avoid crashing when reading a pre-2.0 partition

VAST no longer crashes when reading an unsupported partition from VAST v1.x.
Instead, the partition is ignored correctly. Since v2.2 VAST automatically
rebuilds partitions in the background to ensure compatibility.
