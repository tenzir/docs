### Features

#### Support import filter expressions

VAST now supports import filter expressions. They act as the dual to export
query expressions: `vast import suricata '#type == "suricata.alert"' < eve.json`
will import only `suricata.alert` events, discarding all other events.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1742](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1742).

#### Use a unique version for plugins

Plugin versions are now unique to facilitate debugging. They consist of three
optional parts: (1) the CMake project version of the plugin, (2) the Git
revision of the last commit that touched the plugin, and (3) a `dirty` suffix
for uncommited changes to the plugin. Plugin developers no longer need to
specify the version manually in the plugin entrypoint.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1764](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1764).

#### Add per-layout metrics to imports

VAST now exports per-layout import metrics under the key
`<reader>.events.<layout-name>` in addition to the regular `<reader>.events`.
This makes it easier to understand the event type distribution.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1781](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1781).

#### Fix Docker image builds for arm64

VAST now supports the *arm64* architecture.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1773](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1773).

#### Enable Broker plugin by default for Nix

The static binary now bundles the Broker plugin.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1789](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1789).

#### Publish a tenzir/vast-dev Docker image

VAST now comes with a
[`tenzir/vast-dev`](https://hub.docker.com/r/tenzir/vast-dev) Docker image in
addition to the regular [`tenzir/vast`](https://hub.docker.com/r/tenzir/vast).
The `vast-dev` image targets development contexts, e.g., when building
additional plugins. The image contains all build-time dependencies of VAST and
runs as `root` rather than the `vast` user.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1749](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1749).

#### Add Zeek Broker reader plugin

The new [Broker](https://github.com/zeek/broker) plugin enables seamless log
ingestion from [Zeek](https://github.com/zeek/zeek) to VAST via a TCP socket.
Broker is Zeek's messaging library and the plugin turns VAST into a Zeek [logger
node](https://docs.zeek.org/en/master/frameworks/cluster.html#logger). Use
`vast import broker` to establish a connection to a Zeek node and acquire logs.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#1758](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1758).

#### PRs 1720-1762-1802

VAST has new a `store_plugin` type for custom store backends that hold the raw
data of a partition. The new setting `vast.store-backend` controls the
selection of the store implementation, which has a default value is
`segment-store`. This is still an opt-in feature: unless the configuration
value is set, VAST defaults to the old implementation.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#1720](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1720).

#### Fix bug in bitmap offset computation

`lsvast` now prints extended information for hash indexes.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#1755](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1755).

#### Remove /etc as hardcoded sysconfdir from Nix build

Installing VAST now includes a `vast.yaml.example` configuration file listing
all available options.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1777](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1777).

### Changes

#### Compile with C++20

From now on VAST is compiled with the C++20 language standard.
Minimum compiler versions have increased to GCC 10, Clang 11,
and AppleClang 12.0.5.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#1768](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1768).

#### Bump minimum Debian requirement to Bullseye

VAST no longer officially supports Debian Buster with GCC-8. In CI, VAST now
runs on Debian Bullseye with GCC-10. The provided Docker images now use
`debian:bullseye-slim` as base image. Users that require Debian
Buster support should use the provided static builds instead.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1765](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1765).

#### Disable auto-vectorization in prebuilt Docker images

The `vast` binaries in our [prebuilt Docker
images](http://hub.docker.com/r/tenzir/vast) no longer contain AVX instructions
for increased portability. Building the image locally
continues to add supported auto-vectorization flags automatically.

The following new build options exist: `VAST_ENABLE_AUTO_VECTORIZATION`
enables/disables all auto-vectorization flags, and
`VAST_ENABLE_SSE_INSTRUCTIONS` enables `-msse`; similar options exist for SSE2,
SSE3, SSSE3, SSE4.1, SSE4.2, AVX, and AVX2.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1778](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1778).

### Bug Fixes

#### Support unique plugin versions for Nix and Docker

The official Docker image and static binary distribution of VAST now produce
the correct version output for plugins from the `vast version` command.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1799](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1799).

#### PRs 1804-1809

The disk budget feature no longer triggers a rare segfault while deleting
partitions.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#1804](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1804).

#### Fix sorting of plugins by name

A regression caused VAST's plugins to be loaded in random order, which
printed a warning about mismatching plugins between client and server. The
order is now deterministic.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1756](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1756).

#### Propagate VAST_ENABLE_JOURNALD_LOGGING setting to config header

The `VAST_ENABLE_JOURNALD_LOGGING` CMake option is no longer ignored.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#1780](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1780).

#### Print the import transformer status

The the `status` command now prints information about input and output
transformations.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#1748](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1748).

#### Fix bug in bitmap offset computation

Queries against fields using a `#index=hash` attribute could have missed some
results. Fixing a bug in the offset calculation during bitmap processing
resolved the issue.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#1755](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1755).

#### Fix error message about /dev/null-backend on startup

A `[*** LOG ERROR #0001 ***]` error message on startup under Linux no longer
occurs.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#1754](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1754).

#### Make the source shutdown instantaneous

Import processes now respond quicker. Shutdown requests are no longer delayed
when the server process has busy imports, and metrics reports are now written
in a timely manner.

Particularly busy imports caused the shutdown of the server process to hang,
if import processes were still running or had not yet flushed all data.
The server now shuts down correctly in these cases.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1771](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1771).

#### Fix loading of the optional OpenSSL module

Configuring VAST to use CAF's built-in OpenSSL module via the `caf.openssl.*`
options now works again as expected.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1740](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1740).

#### Normalize GNUInstallDirs for external plugins

Plugins built against an external libvast no longer require the
`CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR` to be specified as a path relative to the configured
`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`. This fixes an issue with plugins in separate packages
for some package managers, e.g., Nix.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1786](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1786).

#### Dont abort JSON import when encountering non-objects

VAST does not abort JSON imports anymore when encountering
something other than a JSON object, e.g., a number or a string.
Instead, VAST skips the offending line.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#1759](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1759).

#### Remove /etc as hardcoded sysconfdir from Nix build

The static binary no longer behaves differently than the regular build with
regards to its configuration directories: system-wide configuration files now
reside in `<prefix>/etc/vast/vast.yaml` rather than `/etc/vast/vast.yaml`.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1777](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1777).
