### Features

#### Add a round of loaders: `http`, `https`, `ftp`, `ftps`

The new connectors `http`, `https`, `ftp`, and `ftps` simplify using remote
files in pipelines via HTTP(S) and FTP(S).

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#3499](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3499).

#### Support parsing of concatenated PCAPs

The `pcap` parser can now process a stream of concatenated PCAP files. On the
command line, you can now parse traces with `cat *.pcap | tenzir 'read pcap'`.
When providing `--emit-file-headers`, each intermediate file header yields a
separate event.

The `nic` loader has a new option `--emit-file-headers` that prepends a PCAP
file header for every batch of bytes that the loader produces, yielding a
stream of concatenated PCAP files.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#3513](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3513).

#### Implement the GCS connector plugin

The new `gcs` connector enables the user to import/export file data from/to GCS
buckets.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#3498](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3498).

#### Support `show nics` to see network interfaces

You can now write `show nics` to get a list of network interfaces. Use `show
nics | select name` to a get a list of possible interface names for `from nic`.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#3517](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3517).

#### Add `lines` parser

The new `lines` parser splits its input at newline characters and produces
events with a single field containing the line.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#3511](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3511).

#### Implement a ZeroMQ connector

The new `zmq` connector ships with a saver and loader for interacting with
ZeroMQ. The loader (source) implements a connecting `SUB` socket and the saver
(sink) a binding `PUB` socket. The `--bind` or `--connect` flags make it
possible to control the direction of connection establishment.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#3497](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3497).

#### Implement the s3 connector

The new `s3` connector enables the user to import/export file data from/to S3
buckets.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#3496](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3496).

### Changes

#### Do not drop the `data` field in `decapsulate`

The `decapsulate` operator no longer drops the PCAP packet data in incoming
events.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3515](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3515).

#### Support parsing of concatenated PCAPs

The long option name `--emit-file-header` of the `pcap` parser is now called
`--emit-file-headers` (plural) to streamline it with the `nic` loader and the
new capability to process concatenated PCAP files.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#3513](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3513).

### Bug Fixes

#### Bump submodule pointer to include pipeline manager deserialization update

Pipelines now show up in the "stopped" instead of the "created" state after the
node restarted.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#3487](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3487).
