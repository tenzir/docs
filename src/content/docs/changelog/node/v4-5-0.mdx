### Features

#### Flush implicitly in the `import` operator

The `import` operator now flushes events to disk automatically before returning,
ensuring that they are available immediately for subsequent uses of the `export`
operator.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3638](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3638).

#### Add an operator blocklist

The `tenzir.disable-plugins` option is a list of names of plugins and builtins
to explicitly forbid from being used in Tenzir. For example, adding `shell`
will prohibit use of the `shell` operator builtin, and adding `kafka` will
prohibit use of the `kafka` connector plugin. This allows for a more
fine-grained control than the `tenzir.allow-unsafe-pipelines` option.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3642](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3642).

#### Relax type restrictions for queries with numeric literals

In `where <expression>`, the types of numeric literals and numeric fields in an
equality or relational comparison must no longer match exactly. The literals
`+42`, `42` or `42.0` now compare against fields of types `int64`, `uint64`, and
`double` as expected.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3634](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3634).

#### Improve `summarize` result for empty inputs

If the `summarize` operator has no `by` clause, it now returns a result even
if there is no input. For example, `summarize num=count(.)` returns an event
with `{"num": 0}`. Aggregation functions which do not have a single default
value, for example because it would depend on the input type, return `null`.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#3640](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3640).

#### Always enable time and bool synopses

Lookups against uint64, int64, double, and duration fields now always use sparse
indexes, which improves the performance of `export | where <expression>` for
some expressions.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3639](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3639).

#### Add an `api` source operator

The `api` source operator interacts with Tenzir's REST API without needing to
spin up a web server, making all APIs accessible from within pipelines.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3630](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3630).

### Changes

#### Use prefix matching instead of suffix matching

The operators `drop`, `pseudonymize`, `put`, `extend`, `replace`, `rename` and
`select` were converted from suffix matching to prefix matching and can
therefore address records now.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#3616](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3616).

#### Always enable time and bool synopses

Sparse indexes for time and bool fields are now always enabled, accelerating
lookups against them.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3639](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3639).

### Bug Fixes

#### Ensure exporter metrics don't get lost

The `exporter.*` metrics will now be emitted in case the exporter finishes
early.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#3633](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3633).

#### Rename `--appending` option for `save file` to `--append`

The long option `--append` for the `file` and `directory` savers now works as
documented. Previously, only the short option worked correctly.
