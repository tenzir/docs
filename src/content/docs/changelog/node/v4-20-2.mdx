## Bug Fixes

### Allow binding to low ports in systemd

The systemd unit now allows binding to privileged ports by default via the
ambient capability `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE`.

### Add OCSF schema type definitions

The empty record type is no longer rejected in schema definitions.

### Fix a use-after-free in the `xsv` parser

We fixed a potential crash in the `csv`, `ssv`, and `tsv` parsers for slowly
arriving inputs.

### Fix the `azure-log-analytics` operator (again)

The `azure-log-analytics` operator sometimes errored on startup complaining
about am unknown `window` option. This no longer occurs.

### Fix compile error with fmt 11.0.2

correctly when using the `tenzir/tenzir-demo` Docker image.

### Set `SO_REUSEADDR` in the UDP connector

Restarting pipelines with the `udp` connector no longer fails to bind to the
socket.
