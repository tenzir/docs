### Bug Fixes

#### Allow binding to low ports in systemd

The systemd unit now allows binding to privileged ports by default via the
ambient capability `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE`.

#### Fix a use-after-free in the `xsv` parser

arriving inputs.

#### Fix the `azure-log-analytics` operator (again)

about am unknown `window` option. This no longer occurs.

Restarting pipelines with the `udp` connector no longer fails to bind to the
socket.
