### Features

#### Allow disabling node-to-node connections

Setting the `tenzir.endpoint` option to `false` now causes the node not to
listen for node-to-node connections. Previously, the port was always exposed for
other nodes or `tenzir` processes to connect.

### Bug Fixes

#### Do not optimize `deduplicate`

We fixed a bug that caused `deduplicate <fields...> --distance <distance>` to
sometimes produce incorrect results when followed by `where <expr>` with an
expression that filters on the deduplicated fields.

#### Don't terminate `export` when used with `every`

Pipelines that use the `every` modifier with the `export` operator no longer
terminate after the first run.
