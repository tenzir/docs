We fixed two bugs in the `to_google_secops` and `to_amazon_security_lake` operators.

Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/releases/tag/v5.12.1).

### Bug Fixes

#### Assertion failures in `to_google_secops`

The `to_google_secops` operator failed assertions when a batch of data was
missing `log_type` or if no input was received for longer than `batch_timeout`.

#### Fixed handling of `time` in `to_amazon_security_lake`

Previously events with a `null` value for the OCSF `time` field would
incorrectly be written to some partition in the lake. In rare circumstances,
this could also cause a crash.

The operator now correctly skips events without a valid `time`.
