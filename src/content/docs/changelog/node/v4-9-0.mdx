### Features

#### Implement `context load`, `context save`, and `context reset`

The `context reset` operator allows for clearing the state of a context.

The `context save` and `context load` operators allow serializing and
deserializing the state of a context to/from bytes.

By [@eliaskosunen](https://github.com/eliaskosunen) in [#3908](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3908).

#### Add new '--file' option to the python operator

The `python` operator gained a new `--file` flag
that allows loading python code from a file instead
of providing it as part of the pipeline definition.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#3901](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3901).

#### Add Bloom filter context

The new `bloom-filter` context represents large sets in a space-efficient
manner.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#3834](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3834).

#### Improve the `export` operator

The `export` operator gained a `--low-priority` option, which causes it to
interfere less with regular priority exports at the cost of potentially running
slower.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3909](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3909).

#### Handle nested fields and integers as selectors in JSON parser

The `--selector` option of the `json` parser now works with nested fields, and
integer fields.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#3900](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3900).

#### Add `lines` printer

The `lines` printer enables simple line-delimited formatting of events.

By [@eliaskosunen](https://github.com/eliaskosunen) in [#3847](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3847).

#### Add the `openapi` operator

The `openapi` source operator generates Tenzir's OpenAPI specification. Use
`openapi | to ./openapi.yaml` to generate a file with the canonical format.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3898](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3898).

#### Add structured_data to syslog output

The `structured_data` field in RFC 5424-style syslog messages is
now parsed and included in the output.

By [@eliaskosunen](https://github.com/eliaskosunen) in [#3871](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3871).

#### Implement a context content dumping mechanism

The new `context inspect <context-name>` command dumps a specific context's
user-provided data, usually the context's content.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#3893](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3893).

#### Support parsing numeric timestamps since epoch

When specifying a schema with a field typed as `time #unit=<unit>`, numeric
values will be interpreted as offsets from the epoch.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#3927](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3927).

#### Add running and paused times to pipeline metrics

Operator metrics now separately track the time that an operator was paused or
running in the `time_paused` and `time_running` values in addition to the
wall-clock time in `time_total`. Throughput rates now exclude the paused time
from their calculation.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3940](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3940).

#### Rewrite `chart` and `set-attributes` operators

The `chart` operator adds metadata to the schema of the input events,
enabling rendering events as bar, area, line, or pie charts on app.tenzir.com.

By [@eliaskosunen](https://github.com/eliaskosunen) in [#3866](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3866).

#### Update the main repository to include timestamped pipelines

`show pipelines` and the `/pipeline` API endpoints now include `created_at` and `last_modified` fields that track the pipeline's creation and last manual modification time, respectively. Pipelines created with older versions of Tenzir will use the start time of the node as their creation time.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#3869](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3869).

#### Implement more malleable lookup data for contexts

The context match events now contain a new field `mode` that states the lookup
mode of this particular match.

The `enrich` operator gained a `--filter` option, which causes it to exclude
enriched events that do not contain a context.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#3920](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3920).

#### Update the main repository to include the pipeline run ID

Managed pipelines now contain a new `total_runs` parameter that counts all
started runs. The new `run` field is available in the events delivered by the
`metrics` and `diagnostics` operators.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#3883](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3883).

### Changes

#### Context versioning

The binary format used by contexts for saving on disk on node shutdown
is now versioned. A node can support loading of multiple different versions,
and automigrate between them.

By [@eliaskosunen](https://github.com/eliaskosunen) in [#3945](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3945).

#### Remove reader, writer, and language plugin types

We removed the `tenzir-ctl start` subcommand. Users should switch to
the `tenzir-node` command instead, which accepts the same arguments
and presents the same command-line interface.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3899](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3899).

#### Disable colors if `NO_COLOR` or not a terminal

Color escape codes are no longer emitted if `NO_COLOR` is set to a non-empty
value, or when the output device is not a terminal.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#3952](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3952).

#### Allow plugins to bundle further builtins

Plugins may now depend on other plugins. Plugins with unmet dependencies are
automatically disabled. For example, the `lookup` and `enrich` plugins now
depend on the `context` plugin. Run `show plugins` to see all available plugins
and their dependencies.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3877](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3877).

#### Replace `tenzir.db-directory` with `tenzir.state-directory`

The option `tenzir.db-directory` is deprecated in favor of the
`tenzir.state-directory` option and will be removed in the future.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3889](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3889).

### Bug Fixes

#### Add support for commas in seconds in the time data parser

Commas are now allowed as subsecond separators in timestamps in TQL.
Previously, only dots were allowed, but ISO 8601 allows for both.

By [@eliaskosunen](https://github.com/eliaskosunen) in [#3903](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3903).

#### Update the repository to include lookup lifetime fixes

Retroactive lookups will now properly terminate when they have finished.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#3910](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3910).

#### Make `/serve` more consistent

The `/serve` API sometimes returned an empty string for the next continuation
token instead of `null` when there are no further results to fetch. It now
consistently returns `null`.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3885](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3885).

#### Prevent duplicate fields in schema

Invalid schema definitions, where a record contains the same key multiple times,
are now detected and rejected.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#3929](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3929).

#### Gracefully handle misaligned header and values in `xsv` parser

The `xsv` parser (and by extension the `csv`, `tsv`, and `ssv` parsers) skipped
 lines that had a mismatch between the number of values contained and the number
 of fields defined in the header. Instead, it now fills in `null` values for
 missing values and, if the new `--auto-expand` option is set, also adds new
 header fields for excess values.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3874](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3874).

#### Fix restart on failure

The option to automatically restart on failure did not correctly trigger for
pipelines that failed an operator emitted an error diagnostic, a new mechanism
for improved error messages introduced with Tenzir v4.8. Such pipelines now
restart automatically as expected.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3947](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3947).

#### Fix logger deadlock in python tests

We fixed a rare deadlock by changing the internal logger behavior from blocking
until the oldest messages were consumed to overwriting them.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#3911](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3911).

#### Improve the `export` operator

We fixed a bug that under rare circumstances led to an indefinite hang when
using a high-volume source followed by a slow transformation and a fast sink.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3909](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3909).
