### Features

#### Implement `encode_base64` and `decode_base64`

The new functions `encode_base64` and `decode_base64` encode and
decode blobs and strings as Base64.

By [@raxyte](https://github.com/raxyte) in [#4806](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4806).

#### Implement `append`, `prepend`, and `concatenate`

The new `append`, `prepend`, and `concatenate` functions add an element to the
end of a list, to the front of a list, and merge two lists, respectively.
`xs.append(y)` is equivalent to `[...xs, y]`, `xs.prepend(y)` is equivalent to
`[y, ...xs]`, and `concatenate(xs, ys)` is equivalent to `[...xs, ..ys]`.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4792](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4792).

#### Implement `otherwise(<expr>, <expr>)`

The function `otherwise(primary:any, fallback:any)` provides a simple way
to specify a `fallback` expression when the `primary` expression
evaluates to `null`.

By [@raxyte](https://github.com/raxyte) in [#4794](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4794).

#### Port `unroll` to TQL2

The `unroll` operator is now available in TQL2. It takes a field of type list,
and duplicates the surrounding event for every element of the list.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4736](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4736).

#### Support decapsulating SLL2 packets

The `decapsulate` function now handles SLL2 frames (Linux cooked capture
encapsulation).

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#4744](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4744).

#### Implement `where` and `map` on lists

The `<list>.map(<capture>, <expression>)` function replaces each value from
`<list>` with the value from `<expression>`. Within `<expression>`, the elements
are available as `<capture>`. For example, to add 5 to all elements in the list
`xs`, use `xs = xs.map(x, x + 5)`.

The `<list>.where(<capture>, <predicate>)` removes all elements from `<list>`
for which the `<predicate>` evaluates to `false`. Within `<predicate>`, the
elements are available as `<capture>`. For example, to remove all elements
smaller than 3 from the list `xs`, use `xs = xs.where(x, x >= 3)`.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4788](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4788).

#### Implement `encode_hex()` and `decode_hex()`

The functions `encode_hex` and `decode_hex` transform strings and blobs to/from
their hexadecimal byte representation.

By [@raxyte](https://github.com/raxyte) in [#4815](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4815).

#### Port Contexts to TQL2

The contexts feature is now available in TQL2. It has undergone significant
changes to make use of TQL2's more powerful expressions. Contexts are shared
between TQL1 and TQL2 pipelines. All operators are grouped in the `context`
module, including the `enrich` and `show contexts` operators, which are now
called `context::enrich` and `context::list`, respectively. To create a new
context, use the `context::create_lookup_table`, `context::create_bloom_filter`,
or `context::create_geoip` operators.

Lookup table contexts now support separate create, write, and read timeouts via
the `create_timeout`, `write_timeout`, and `read_timeout` options, respectively.
The options are exclusive to contexts updated with TQL2's `context::update`
operator.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4753](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4753).

#### Improve `to_splunk` TLS functionality

The `to_splunk` operator now supports the `cacert`, `certfile`, and `keyfile`
options to provide certificates for the TLS connection.

By [@raxyte](https://github.com/raxyte) in [#4825](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4825).

#### Implement `--limit` flag for the `chart` operator

The `--limit` option for the TQL1 `chart` operator controls the previously
hardcoded upper limit on the number of events in a chart. The option defaults
to 10,000 events.

By [@IyeOnline](https://github.com/IyeOnline) in [#4757](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4757).

#### Add `parse_time` and `format_time` methods

The new `parse_time` and `format_time` functions transform strings into
timestamps and vice versa.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#4576](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4576).

#### Implement `x[y]` record indexing

Indexing records with string expressions is now supported.

By [@raxyte](https://github.com/raxyte) in [#4795](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4795).

#### Implement `split`, `split_regex`, and `join`

The `split` and `split_regex` functions split a string into a list of strings
based on a delimiter or a regular expression, respectively.

The `join` aggregation function concatenates a strings into a single string,
optionally separated by a delimiter.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4799](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4799).

#### Fix crash in `context::enrich` for heterogeneous enrichments

The `network` function returns the network address of a CIDR subnet. For
example, `192.168.0.0/16.network()` returns `192.168.0.0`.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4828](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4828).

#### Introduce a `zip` function for merging lists

The `zip` function merges two lists into a single list of a record with two
fields `left` and `right`. For example, `zip([1, 2], [3, 4])` returns `[{left:
1, right: 3}, {left: 2, right: 4}]`.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4803](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4803).

#### PRs 4716-4807

The following operators are now available in TQL2 for loading and
saving: `load_amqp`, `save_amqp`, `load_ftp`, `save_ftp`, `load_nic`,
`load_s3`, `save_s3`, `load_sqs`, `save_sqs`, `load_udp`, `save_udp`,
`load_zmq`, `save_zmq`, `save_tcp` and `save_email`.

The following new operators are available in TQL2 to convert event
streams to byte streams in various formats: `write_csv`, `write_feather`,
`write_json`, `write_lines`, `write_ndjson`, `write_parquet`, `write_pcap`, `write_ssv`, `write_tsv`,
`write_xsv`, `write_yaml`, `write_zeek_tsv`.

By [@raxyte](https://github.com/raxyte) in [#4716](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4716).

#### Allow aggregation functions to be called on lists

Aggregation functions now work on lists. For example, `[1, 2, 3].sum()` will
return `6`, and `["foo", "bar", "baz"].map(x, x == "bar").any()` will return
`true`.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4821](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4821).

#### Port `unordered`, `local`, and `remote` to TQL2

The `local` and `remote` operators allow for overriding the location of a
pipeline. Local operators prefer running at a client `tenzir` process, and
remote operators prefer running at a remote `tenzir-node` process. These
operators are primarily intended for testing purposes.

The `unordered` operator throws away the order of events in a pipeline. This
causes some operators to run faster, e.g., `read_ndjson` is able to parse events
out of order through this. This operator is primarily intended for testing
purposes, as most of the time the ordering requirements are inferred from
subsequent operators in the pipeline.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4835](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4835).

### Changes

#### Stop URL-encoding pub/sub topics

The topics provided to the `publish` and `subscribe` operators now exactly match
the `topic` field in the corresponding metrics.

Using `publish` and `subscribe` without an explicitly provided topic now uses
the topic `main` as opposed to an implementation-defined special name.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4738](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4738).

#### Finish porting loaders, printers and savers

The option `ndjson` for `write_json` operator has been removed in favor of a new
operator `write_ndjson`.

By [@raxyte](https://github.com/raxyte) in [#4762](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4762).

#### PRs 4741-4746

The functions `ocsf_category_name`, `ocsf_category_uid`, `ocsf_class_name`, and
`ocsf_class_uid` are now called `ocsf::category_name`, `ocsf::category_uid`,
`ocsf::class_name`, and `ocsf::class_uid`, respectively. Similarly, the
`package_add`, `package_remove`, `packages`, and `show pipelines` operators are
now called `package::add`, `package::remove`, `package::list`, and
`pipeline::list`, respectively.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#4741](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4741).

#### Improve names for the `cache` operator's timeout options

The `cache` operator's `ttl` and `max_ttl` options are now called `read_timeout`
and `write_timeout`, respectively.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4758](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4758).

#### Prepare small fixes for release

The new `string` function now replaces the `str` function. The older `str`
name will be available as an alias for some time for compatibility but will
be removed in a future release.

By [@raxyte](https://github.com/raxyte) in [#4834](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4834).

#### Align argument parser usage format with docs

The usage string that is reported when an operator or function is being used
incorrectly now uses the same format as the documentation.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#4740](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4740).

#### Improve `to_splunk` TLS functionality

The `tls_no_verify` option of the `to_splunk` operator is now called
`skip_peer_verification`.

By [@raxyte](https://github.com/raxyte) in [#4825](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4825).

### Bug Fixes

#### Add timeout to multiline syslog

We fixed an oversight in the syslog parsers, which caused it to not yield an
event until the next line came in.

By [@IyeOnline](https://github.com/IyeOnline) in [#4829](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4829).

#### Port Loaders, Printers, Savers

The docs for the `sqs` connector now correctly reflect the default of `3s` for
the `--poll-time` option.

By [@raxyte](https://github.com/raxyte) in [#4716](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4716).

#### Ignore whole line when NDJSON parser fails

The `read_ndjson` operator no longer uses an error-prone mechanism to continue
parsing an NDJSON line that contains an error. Instead, the entire line is
skipped.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#4801](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4801).

#### Introduce `{package,pipeline}::list`

`context inspect` crashed when used to inspect a context that was previously
updated with `context update` with an input containing a field of type `enum`.
This no longer happens.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4746](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4746).

#### Don't allow manual erasing of contexts from packages

It is no longer possible to manually remove contexts
that are installed as part of a package.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#4768](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4768).

#### Fix ODR violation of `tenzir::socket` type

The TQL1 and TQL2 `sockets` operators no longer crash on specific builds.

By [@raxyte](https://github.com/raxyte) in [#4816](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4816).

#### Improve `to_splunk` TLS functionality

The `max_content_length` option for the `to_splunk` operator was named incorrectly in
an earlier version to `send_timeout`. This has now been fixed.

By [@raxyte](https://github.com/raxyte) in [#4825](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4825).

#### Prepend the field added by `enumerate`

The `enumerate` operator now correctly prepends the added index field instead of
appending it.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4756](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4756).

#### Add missing `co_yield`s in `save_http`

The TQL2 `save_http` operator had a bug causing it to fail to connect and
get stuck in an infinite loop. This is now fixed and works as expected.

By [@raxyte](https://github.com/raxyte) in [#4833](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4833).

#### Fix `str` function quotes

The `str` function no longer adds extra quotes when given a string. For example,
`str("") == "\"\""` was changed to `str("") == ""`.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#4809](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4809).

#### Port Contexts to TQL2

The last metric emitted for each run of the `enrich` operator was incorrectly
named `tenzir.enrich.metrics` instead of `tenzir.metrics.enrich`, causing it not
to be available via `metrics enrich`.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4753](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4753).

#### Make `to_hive` a "local" operator

The `to_hive` operator now correctly writes files relative to the working
directory of a `tenzir` client process instead of relative to the node.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4771](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4771).
