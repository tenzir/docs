### Features

#### PRs 4133-4138-satta

The `suricata` parser's schema now more accurately reflects Suricata's Eve JSON
output, adding many fields that were previously missing.

By [@satta](https://github.com/satta) in [#4133](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4133).

#### Add value grouping to `chart` and remove `--title`

Some charts supported by the `chart` operator (`bar`, `line`, and `area`)
now have a `--position` argument, with the possible values of
`grouped` and `stacked`.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#4119](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4119).

#### Add a `--timeout <duration>` option to `batch`

The `batch` operator gained a new `--timeout <duration>` option that controls
the maixmum latency for withholding events for batching.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4095](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4095).

#### Add configurable contexts

You can now define contexts and their creation parameters in the
`tenzir.contexts` section of the configuration file.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#4126](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4126).

#### Add `show schemas` to display all available schemas

The `show schemas` operator lists all unique schemas of events stored at the
node.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4131](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4131).

#### Introduce the BITZ format

The `bitz` format resembles Tenzir's internal wire format. It enables lossless
and quick transfer of events between Tenzir nodes through any connector.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4079](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4079).

#### Add a delay to retrying failed pipelines

Stopping a failed pipeline now moves it into the stopped state in the app and
through the `/pipeline/update` API, stopping automatic restarts on failure.

Pipelines now restart on failure at most every minute. The new API parameter
`retry_delay` is available in the `/pipeline/create`, `/pipeline/launch`, and
`/pipeline/update` APIs to customize this value. For configured pipelines, the
new `restart-on-error` option supersedes the previous `autostart.failed` option
and may be set either to a boolean or to a duration, with the former using the
default retry delay and the latter using a custom one.

The output of `show pipelines` and the `/pipeline/list` API now includes the
start time of the pipeline in the field `start_time`, the newly added retry
delay in the field `retry_delay`, and whether the pipeline is hidden from the
overview page on app.tenzir.com in the field `hidden`.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#4108](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4108).

#### Add `unroll` operator

The `unroll` operator transforms an event that contains a list into a sequence
of events where each output event contains one of the list elements.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#4078](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4078).

#### Add UDP connector

The new `udp` connector comes with a loader and saver to read bytes from and
write bytes to a UDP socket.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#4067](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4067).

#### Support 0mq inproc sockets

The `0mq` connector now supports `inproc` socket endpoint URLs, allowing you to
create arbitrary publish/subscribe topologies within a node. For example, `save
zmq inproc://foo` writes messages to the in-process socket named `foo`.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#4117](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4117).

#### Generalize `every` to work with all operators

The `every <duration>` operator modifier now supports all operators, turning
blocking operators like `tail`, `sort` or `summarize` into operators that emit
events every `<duration>`.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4109](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4109).

#### Add multi-line syslog message support

Syslog messages spanning multiple lines are now supported.

By [@eliaskosunen](https://github.com/eliaskosunen) in [#4080](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4080).

#### Add `deduplicate` operator

The `deduplicate` operator allows removing duplicate events based on
specific fields.

By [@eliaskosunen](https://github.com/eliaskosunen) in [#4068](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4068).

### Changes

#### Support 0mq inproc sockets

The `0mq` connector no longer automatically monitors TCP sockets to wait until
at least one remote peer is present. Explicitly pass `--monitor` for this
behavior.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#4117](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4117).

#### Remove metrics from `/pipeline/list`

The `show pipelines` operator and `/pipeline/list` endpoint no longer include
pipeline metrics. We recommend using the `metrics` operator instead, which
offers the same data in a more flexible way.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4114](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4114).

#### Add value grouping to `chart` and remove `--title`

In the `chart` operator, unless otherwise specified, every field but the
first one is taken to be a value for the Y-axis, instead of just the second one.

If the value for `-x`/`--name` or `-y`/`--value` is explicitly specified, the
other one must now be too.

The `--title` option is removed from `chart`. Titles can instead be set directly
in the web interface.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#4119](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4119).

#### Remove many deprecated things

The `tenzir-ctl count <expr>` command no longer exists. It has long been
deprecated and superseded by pipelines of the form `export | where <expr> |
summarize count(.)`.

The deprecated `tenzir-ctl status` command and the corresponding `/status`
endpoint no longer exist. They have been superseded by the `show` and `metrics`
operators that provide more detailed insight.

The deprecated `tenzir.aging-frequency` and `tenzir.aging-query` options no
longer exist. We recommend using the compaction or disk monitor mechanisms
instead to delete persisted events.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4103](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4103).

#### Add multi-line syslog message support

Lines of input containing an invalid syslog messages are now assumed to
be a continuation of a message on a previous line, if there's any.

By [@eliaskosunen](https://github.com/eliaskosunen) in [#4080](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4080).

#### Remove events output from many context operators

The `context create`, `context reset`, `context update`, and `context load`
operators no return information about the context. Pipelines ending with these
operators will now be considered closed, and you will be asked to deploy them in
the Explorer. Previously, users commonly added `discard` after these operators
to force this behavior.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4143](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4143).

#### Implement feather printer and parser

The `feather` format now reads and writes Arrow IPC streams in addition to
Feather files, and no longer requires random access to a file to function,
making the format streamable with both `read feather` and `write feather`.

By [@balavinaithirthan](https://github.com/balavinaithirthan) in [#4089](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4089).

#### Implement a `parquet` parser and printer

The `parquet` format more efficiently reads and writes Parquet files. The format is streamable for `write parquet`.

By [@balavinaithirthan](https://github.com/balavinaithirthan) in [#4116](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4116).

### Bug Fixes

#### Make `python` operator not discard fields that start with an underscore

The `python` operator no longer discards field that start with an underscore.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#4085](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4085).

#### Support parallel connections in `from tcp`

The `tcp` connector now supports accepting multiple connections in parallel when
used with the `from` operator, parsing data separately per connection.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4084](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4084).

#### Fix shutdown of connected pipelines alongside node

Pipelines run with the `tenzir` binary that connected to a Tenzir Node did
sometimes not shut down correctly when the node shut down. This now happens
reliably.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4093](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4093).

#### Remove wrong EXPOSE in Dockerfile

Tenzir Docker images no longer expose 5158/tcp by default, as this prevented
running multiple containers in the same network or in host mode.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4099](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4099).

#### Fix unflattening of empty records and `null` records

Empty records and `null` values of record type are now correctly unflattened.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#4104](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4104).

#### Remove events output from many context operators

The `enrich` operator sometimes stopped working when it encountered an event for
which the specified fields did not exist. This no longer happens.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4143](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4143).

#### Fix verification of large FlatBuffers tables

Lookup tables with more than 1M entries failed to load after the node was
restarted. This no longer happens.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4137](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4137).

#### Fix a race condition in `/serve`

We fixed a bug that caused the explorer to sometimes show 504 Gateway Timeout
errors for pipelines where the first result took over two seconds to arrive.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4123](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4123).

#### Shut down node a configured pipeline fails to start

Nodes now shut down with a non-zero exit code when pipelines configured as part
of the `tenzir.yaml` file fail to start, making such configuration errors easier
to spot.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4097](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4097).

#### Fix HTTP saver Content-Length computation

The `http` saver now correctly sets the `Content-Length` header value for HTTP
POST requests.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#4134](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4134).

#### Fix the schema name in `show contexts`

The schema name of events returned by `show contexts` sometimes did not match
the type of the context. This now works reliably.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4082](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4082).

#### Fix JSON printer handling of `inf` and `nan`

The JSON printer previously printed invalid JSON for `inf` and `nan`, which
means that `serve` could sometimes emit invalid JSON, which is not handled well
by platform/app. Instead, we now emit `null`.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#4087](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4087).

#### Fix HTTP PUT with empty request body

We fixed a bug in the `http` saver that prevented sending HTTP PUT requests with
an empty request body.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#4092](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4092).

#### Fix `python` deadlock for empty input

The `python` operator no longer deadlocks when given an empty program.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#4086](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4086).
