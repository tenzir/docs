### Changes

#### PRs 4073-satta

The `python` operator now requires Python 3.9 (down from Python 3.10) or newer,
making it available on more systems.

By [@satta](https://github.com/satta) in [#4073](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4073).

### Bug Fixes

#### Fail late in the python operator setup

The `python` operator often failed with a 504 Gateway Timeout error on
app.tenzir.com when first run. This no longer happens.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#4066](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4066).
