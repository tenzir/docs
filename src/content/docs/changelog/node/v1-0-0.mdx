## Features

### Introduce the `#import_time` meta extractor

The `#import_time` meta extractor allows for querying events based on the time
they arrived at the VAST server process. It may only be used for comparisons
with [time value
literals](https://vast.io/docs/understand/query-language/expressions#values),
e.g., `vast export json '#import_time > 1 hour ago'` exports all events that
were imported within the last hour as NDJSON.

### Add a `--omit-nulls` option to the JSON export

The new `--omit-nulls` option to the `vast export json` command causes VAST to
skip over fields in JSON objects whose value is `null` when rendering them.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2004](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2004).

### Create projection plugin

VAST has a new transform step: `project`, which keeps the fields with configured
key suffixes and removes the rest from the input. At the same time, the `delete`
transform step can remove not only one but multiple fields from the input based
on the configured key suffixes.

By [@6yozo](https://github.com/6yozo) in [#2000](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2000).

### Implement a selection transform plugin

VAST has a new transform step: `select`, which keeps rows matching the
configured expression and removes the rest from the input.

By [@6yozo](https://github.com/6yozo) in [#2014](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2014).

## Changes

### Upgrade the minimum Arrow dependency to 6.0

Building VAST now requires Arrow >= 6.0.

By [@dispanser](https://github.com/dispanser) in [#2033](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2033).

### Prepare repository for VAST v1.0.0-rc1

VAST no longer uses calendar-based versioning. Instead, it uses a semantic
versioning scheme. A new VERSIONING.md document installed alongside VAST
explores the semantics in-depth.

Plugins now have a separate version. The build scaffolding installs README.md
and CHANGELOG.md files in the plugin source tree root automatically.

## Bug Fixes

### Create intermediate dirs for db-directory and respect schema-dirs in bare mode

VAST no longer ignores the `--schema-dirs` option when using `--bare-mode`.

Starting VAST no longer fails if creating the database directory requires
creating intermediate directories.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2046](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2046).

### Start the telemetry loop of the index correctly

The index now emits the metrics `query.backlog.{low,normal}` and
`query.workers.{idle,busy}` reliably.
