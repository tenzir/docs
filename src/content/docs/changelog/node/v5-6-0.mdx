The  operator now supports event-dependent topics, making routing between pipelines more flexible. Additionally, new  and  operators make taking apart custom logs easier than before.

Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/releases/tag/v5.6.0).

### Features

#### `read_delimited` and `read_delimited_regex`

TQL now supports two new operators for parsing data streams with custom
delimiters: `read_delimited` and `read_delimited_regex`. These operators provide a more
intuitive and discoverable way to split data on custom separators compared to
the deprecated `split_at_regex` option in `read_lines`.

The `read_delimited` operator splits input on exact string or blob matches:

```tql
load_file "data.txt"
read_delimited "||"
```

The `read_delimited_regex` operator splits input using regular expression patterns:

```tql
load_tcp "0.0.0.0:514" {
  read_delimited_regex "(?=<[0-9]+>)"
}
```

Both operators support binary data processing and optionally including the
separator in the output. The `split_at_regex` option in `read_lines` is now
deprecated in favor of these dedicated operators.

#### Publishing to dynamic topics

The `publish` operator now allows for dynamic topics to be derived from each
individual event.

For example, assuming Suricata logs, `publish f"suricata.{event_type}"` now
publishes to the topic `suricata.alert` for alert events and `suricata.flow` for
flow events. This works with any expression that evaluates to a string,
including `publish @name` to use the schema name of the event.

#### HTTP request metadata

The `from_http` operator now supports the `metadata_field` option when using the
server mode and not just client mode. The request metadata has the following
schema:

| Field                | Type     | Description                           |
| :------------------- | :------- | :------------------------------------ |
| `headers`            | `record` | The request headers.                 |
| `query`              | `record` | The query parameters of the request.  |
| `path`               | `string` | The path requested.                   |
| `fragment`           | `string` | The URI fragment of the request.      |
| `method`             | `string` | The HTTP method of the request.       |
| `version`            | `string` | The HTTP version of the request.      |

### Bug Fixes

#### OCSF `-dev` versions

The `ocsf::apply` operator can now be used with the newest development version
of OCSF (v1.6.0-dev). Previously, it claimed that this version does not exist.

#### Fixed panic in `write_parquet`

The `write_parquet` operator no longer panics when specifying
`compression_type="snappy"` without a `compression_level`.
