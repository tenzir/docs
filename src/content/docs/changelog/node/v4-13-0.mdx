### Features

#### Add new loading mechanism for GeoIP context

The `geoip` context now supports loading in a MaxMind database with `context
load <ctx>`. For example, `load s3://my-bucket/file.mmdb | context load my-ctx`
makes the GeoIP context use a remotely stored database.

#### Add LEEF parser

The new `leef` parser supports parsing Log Event Extended Format (LEEF) version
1.0 and 2.0 events, e.g.,
`LEEF:1.0|Microsoft|MSExchange|4.0 SP1|15345|src=192.0.2.0\tdst=172.50.123.1`.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#4178](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4178).

#### Add `cron` operator

The `cron "<cron expression>"` operator modifier executes an operator
on a schedule.
For example, `cron "* */10 * * * MON-FRI" from https://example.org/api`
queries an endpoint on every 10th minute, Monday through Friday.

#### Add `--precise` mode to JSON parser

The `json` parser has a new `--precise` flag, which ensures that the layout of
the emitted events precisely match the input. For example, it guarantees that no
additional `null` fields will be added. This mode is implicitly enabled when
using `read gelf`.

### Changes

#### Remove the --clear parameter for lookup table contexts

The `--clear` parameter for clearing lookup table contexts during an update no
longer exists. It has been superseded by the more robust `context reset`
operator.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#4179](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4179).

#### Fix a hang on shutdown and remove deprecated things

The deprecated `matcher` plugin no longer exists. Use the superior `lookup`
operator and contexts instead.

The deprecated `tenzir-ctl import` and `tenzir-ctl export` commands no longer
exists. They have been fully superseded by pipelines in the form `… | import`
and `export | …`, respectively.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4187](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4187).

### Bug Fixes

#### Add LEEF parser

The `syslog` parser no longer crops messages at unprintable characters, such as
tab (`\t`).

The `syslog` parser no longer eagerly attempts to grab an application name from
the content, fixing issues when combined with CEF and LEEF.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#4178](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4178).

#### Fix CSV/XSV format printing the header once for each batch

The CSV, TSV, and SSV printers no longer erroneously print the header multiple
times when more than one event batch of events arrives.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#4195](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4195).

#### Update the repository to include retry delay-related bug fixes

Some pipelines did not restart on failure. The retry mechanism now works for all
kinds of failures.

Pipelines that are configured to automatically restart on failure can now be
stopped explicitly. Stopping a failed pipeline now always changes its state to
the stopped state.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#4184](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4184).

#### Fix a hang on shutdown and remove deprecated things

Startup failures caused by invalid pipelines or contexts deployed as code in the
configuration file sometimes caused the node to hang instead of shutting down
with an error message. The node now shuts down as expected when this happens.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4187](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4187).

#### Make python venv creation independent from the user

A permission error caused `python` operator to fail when it was previously used
by another system user with the same set of requirements. There now is a one
Python environment per user and set of requirements.
