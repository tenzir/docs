This patch release comes with a few new experimental memory metrics. Furthermore, it resolves an issue where the memory usage would grow without bounds on some systems.

Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/releases/tag/v5.20.1).

### Bug Fixes

#### Fixed excessive memory allocation

We have switched the allocator back to the system allocator for now, as the
`mimalloc` setup led to significant memory usage issues on some systems.

Furthermore, we added quite a few experimental memory-usage related metrics to
`metrics "memory"`, providing additional insight into the memory usage of
Tenzir.
