### Features

#### Add timeout options to `summarize`

The `summarize` operator gained two new options: `timeout` and `update-timeout`,
which enable streaming aggregations. They specifiy the maximum time a bucket in
the operator may exist, tracked from the arrival of the first and last event in
the bucket, respectively. The `timeout` is useful to guarantee that events are
held back no more than the specified duration, and the `update-timeout` is
useful to finish aggregations earlier in cases where events that would be sorted
into the same buckets arrive within the specified duration, allowing results to
be seen earlier.

#### Add statistical aggregation functions

The new `mean` aggregation function computes the mean of grouped numeric values.

The new `approximate_median` aggregation function computes an approximate median
of grouped numeric values using the t-digest algorithm.

The new `stddev` and `variance` aggregation functions compute the standard
deviation and variance of grouped numeric values, respectively.

The new `collect` aggregation function collects a list of all non-null grouped
values. Unlike `distinct`, this function does not remove dulicates and the
results may appear in any order.

#### Implement strides for the `slice` operator

The `slice` operator now supports strides in the form of `slice
<begin>:<end>:<stride>`. Negative strides reverse the event order. The new
`reverse` operator is a short form of `slice ::-1` and reverses the event order.

### Changes

#### Change the syntax of the `slice` operator

The `slice` operator now expects its arguments in the form `<begin>:<end>`,
where either the begin or the end value may be omitted. For example, `slice 10:`
returns all but the first 10 events, `slice 10:20` returns events 10 to 20
(exclusive), and `slice :-10` returns all but the last 10 events.

### Bug Fixes

#### Remove the superfluous path separators when using S3 or GS connectors

Paths for `s3` and `gs` connectors are not broken anymore during
loading/saving.

#### Make syslog parser more lenient

The `syslog` parser incorrectly identified a message without hostname and tag as
one with hostname and no tag. This resulted in a hostname with a trailing colon,
e.g., `zscaler-nss:`. In such messages, the parser now correctly sets the
hostname to `null` and assigns `zscaler-nss` as tag/app, without the trailing
colon.
