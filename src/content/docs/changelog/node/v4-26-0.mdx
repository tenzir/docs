### Features

#### Introduce CAF metrics

`metrics "caf"` offers insights into Tenzir's underlying actor system. This is
primarily aimed at developers for performance benchmarking.

The new `merge` function combines two records. `merge(foo, bar)` is a shorthand
for `{...foo, ...bar}`.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4897](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4897).

#### TQL printer

You can use the new `write_tql` operator to print events as TQL expressions.

We added `strip` options to `write_json` and `write_ndjson`, allowing you to
strip null fields as well as empty records or lists.

By [@IyeOnline](https://github.com/IyeOnline) in [#4921](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4921).

#### Implement `match_regex`

You can use the new `string.match_regex(regex:string)` function to check whether
a string partially matches a regular expression.

By [@IyeOnline](https://github.com/IyeOnline) in [#4917](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4917).

#### Implement `to_asl` operator

We added a `to_asl` operator that can be used to send OCSF normalized events
to an Amazon Security Lake.

### Changes

#### TQL printer

The implicit sources and sinks that can be set via commandline options or
configuration now use TQL2.

The default implicit event sink now writes TQL values instead of JSON.

#### Fix overzealous parameter validation in `/pipeline/launch`

Contexts persist less frequently now in the background, reducing their resource
usage.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4919](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4919).

#### Improve configured pipeline startup errors

Errors from the startup of configured pipelines, including those coming from
configured packages, now have improved rendering.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#4886](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4886).

#### Use adaptive resolution and `Z` suffix in timestamp printer

Timestamps are now printed with a `Z` suffix to indicate that they are relative
to UTC. Furthermore, the fractional part of the seconds is no longer always
printed using 6 digits. Instead, timestamps that do not have sub-second
information no longer have a fractional part. Other timestamps are either
printed with 3, 6 or 9 fractional digits, depending on their resolution.

Durations that are printed as minutes now use `min` instead of `m`.
Additionally, the fractional part of durations is now printed with full
precision instead of being rounded to two digits.

### Bug Fixes

#### Fix CONVERSION part for GROK patterns

We fixed a bug which broke the CONVERSION part of the GROK pattern semantic.

By [@IyeOnline](https://github.com/IyeOnline) in [#4939](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4939).

#### Fix overzealous parameter validation in `/pipeline/launch`

We fixed an overzealous parameter validation bug that prevented the use of the
`/pipeline/launch` API endpoint when specifying a `cache_id` without a
`serve_id` when `definition` contained a definition for a pipeline without a
sink.
