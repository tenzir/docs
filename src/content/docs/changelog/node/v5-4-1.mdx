This release fixes a bug within the JSON printer that could lead to invalid JSON being produced, and also led to response timeouts when using the Tenzir Platform.

Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/releases/tag/v5.4.1).

### Bug Fixes

#### Incorrect values when charting

The charting operators did not update aggregations correctly, which resulted in
out-of-sync or `null` values.

#### Fixed invalid JSON for small numbers

Operators such as `write_json` previously emitted invalid JSON for small
numbers. This also affected the Tenzir Platform as it invalidated some
responses, which could lead to no data showing up in the Explorer.
