## ✨ Features

### Cloud matchers

We can now use matchers in AWS using the vast-cloud CLI matcher plugin.

By [@rdettai](https://github.com/rdettai) in [#2473](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2473).

### Make the connection timeout configurable

The new `vast.connection-timeout` option allows for configuring the timeout VAST
clients use when connecting to a VAST server. The value defaults to 10s; setting
it to a zero duration causes produces an infinite timeout.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2499](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2499).

### Make the `rebuild` command more reliable

VAST now continuously rebuilds outdated and merges undersized partitions in the
background. The new option `vast.automatic-rebuild` controls how many resources
to spend on this. To disable this behavior, set the option to 0; the default is
1.

Rebuilding now emits metrics under the keys
`rebuilder.partitions.{remaining,rebuilding,completed}`. The `vast status
rebuild` command additionally shows information about the ongoing rebuild.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2493](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2493).

### Implement optional dense indexes

VAST's partition indexes are now optional, allowing operators to control the
trade-off between disk-usage and query performance for every field.

By [@patszt](https://github.com/patszt) in [#2430](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2430).

## 🔄 Changes

### Lower the impact of low-priority queries

We improved the operability of VAST servers under high load from automated
low-priority queries. VAST now considers queries issued with `--low-priority`,
such as automated retro-match queries, with even less priority compared to
regular queries (down from 33.3% to 4%) and internal high-priority queries used
for rebuilding and compaction (down from 12.5% to 1%).

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2484](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2484).

### Make the `rebuild` command more reliable

The default value for `vast.active-partition-timeout` is now 5 minutes (down
from 1 hour), causing VAST to persist underful partitions earlier.

We split the `vast rebuild` command into two: `vast rebuild start` and `vast
rebuild stop`. Rebuild orchestration now runs server-side, and only a single
rebuild may run at a given time. We also made it more intuitive to use:
`--undersized` now implies `--all`, and a new `--detached` option allows for
running rebuilds in the background.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2493](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2493).

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Respect `--connection-timeout` in more places

Configuration options representing durations with an associated command-line
option like `vast.connection-timeout` and `--connection-timeout` were not picked
up from configuration files or environment variables. This now works as
expected.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2503](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2503).

### Add active partition actor to unpersisted partitions on decomission

VAST no longer occasionally prints warnings about no longer available partitions
when queries run concurrently to imports.

By [@patszt](https://github.com/patszt) in [#2500](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2500).

### Implement a flatbuffer container class to hold excess table slices in segments

VAST can now store data in segments bigger than 2GiB in size each.

VAST can now store column indexes that are bigger than 2GiB.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#2449](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2449).

### Implement optional dense indexes

VAST properly processes queries for fields with `skip` attribute.

By [@patszt](https://github.com/patszt) in [#2430](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2430).

### Wait until all stores have exited before finishing a partition transform

Fixed a race condition where the output of a partition transform
could be reused before it was fully written to disk, for example
when running `vast rebuild`.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#2543](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2543).

### Display store load failures to the user

Partitions now fail early when their stores fail to load from disk, detailing
what went wrong in an error message.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2507](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2507).

### Activate cloud plugins explicitely

We changed the way `vast-cloud` is loading its cloud plugins to make it more
explicit. This avoids inconsitent defaults assigned to variables when using core
commands on specific plugins.

By [@rdettai](https://github.com/rdettai) in [#2510](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2510).

### Don't abort startup if individual partitions fail to load

The `rebuild` command, automatic rebuilds, and compaction are now much faster,
and match the performance of the `import` command for building indexes.
