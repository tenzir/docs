This release brings forth improvements to HTTP support in Tenzir, supporting requests as transformations and paginating APIs.

Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/releases/tag/v5.3.0).

### Features

#### Implement `http` operator

We implemented the `http` operator that allows making HTTP/1.1 requests to a
URL. The operator also allows paginate APIs based on the responses.

#### Introduce lambda functions

TQL now supports lambda expressions. They are supported in the `where` and `map`
functions on list, and on the newly added `count_if` aggregation function.
Instead of `[1, 2, 3].map(x, x + 1)`, use `[1, 2, 3].map(x => x + 1)`. This
subtle change makes it obvious that the expression is not evaluated on the
entire list, but rather on each element individually.

The `count_if` aggregation function counts the number of elements in a list that
satisfy a given predicate. For example, `[1, 2, 3].count_if(x => x > 1)` returns
`2`.

#### Implement `from_http` client

The `from_http` operator now supports HTTP client functionality. This allows
sending HTTP/1.1 requests, including support for custom methods, headers,
payloads, pagination, retries, and connection timeouts. The operator can be used
to fetch data from HTTP APIs and ingest it directly into pipelines.

Make a simple GET request auto-selecting the parser:

```tql
from_http "https://api.example.com/data"
```

Post data to some API:

```tql
from_http "https://api.example.com/submit", payload={foo: "bar"}.print_json(),
          headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"}
```

Paginating APIs:

```tql
from_http "https://api.example.com/items",
          paginate=(x => x.next_url if x.has_more? == true)
```

### Changes

#### `load_http` deprecated

The `from` operator now dispatches to `from_http` for `http[s]` URLs.

The `load_http` operator is now deprecated in favor of `from_http`.

### Bug Fixes

#### Fix a segfault in `save_amqp` on connection loss

We fixed a crash in `save_amqp` when trying to send a message after the connection
was lost.

By [@IyeOnline](https://github.com/IyeOnline) in [#5226](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5226).

#### Fix overflow warning for `-9223372036854775808`

The lowest 64-bit integer, `-9223372036854775808`, no longer causes an overflow
warning.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#5223](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5223).

#### Fix a crash in `to_clickhouse`

We fixed an issue when trying to send lists in `to_clickhouse` that would cause
the ClickHouse server to drop the connection.

By [@IyeOnline](https://github.com/IyeOnline) in [#5231](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5231).

#### Fix evaluation of `null if true else â€¦`

The expression `null if true else 42` previously returned `42`. It now correctly
returns `null`.
