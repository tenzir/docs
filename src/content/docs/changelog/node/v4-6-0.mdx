### Features

#### Add `apply` operator

The new `apply` operator includes pipelines defined in other files.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#3677](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3677).

#### Add `parse` operator

The new, experimental `parse` operator applies a parser to the string stored in
a given field.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#3665](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3665).

#### Add `from/load/to/save <uri/file>`

The operators `from`, `to`, `load`, and `save` support using URLs and file paths
directly as their argument. For example, `load https://example.com` means
`load https https://example.com`, and `save local-file.json` means
`save file local-file.json`.

By [@eliaskosunen](https://github.com/eliaskosunen) in [#3608](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3608).

#### Add `syslog` parser

The `syslog` parser allows reading both RFC 5424 and RFC 3164 syslog messages.

By [@eliaskosunen](https://github.com/eliaskosunen) in [#3645](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3645).

#### Add `yield` operator

The new `yield` operator extracts nested records with the ability to unfold
lists.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#3651](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3651).

#### Introduce an experimental `python` pipeline operator

The `python` operator adds the ability to perform arbitrary event to event
transformations with the full power of Python 3.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#3592](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3592).

#### Implement a TCP loader

We added a new `tcp` connector that allows reading raw bytes
from TCP or TLS connections.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3664](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3664).

#### Add file extension detection to `from`/`to`

When using `from <URL>` and `to <URL>` without specifying the format explicitly
using a `read`/`write` argument, the default format is determined by the file
extension for all loaders and savers, if possible. Previously, that was only
done when using the `file` loader/saver. Additionally, if the file name would
indicate some sort of compression (e.g. `.gz`), compression and decompression is
performed automatically. For example, `from https://example.com/myfile.yml.gz`
is expanded to `load https://example.com/myfile.yml.gz | decompress gzip | read
yaml` automatically.

By [@eliaskosunen](https://github.com/eliaskosunen) in [#3653](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3653).

#### Support `show`-ing all aspects at once

Use `show` without an aspect to return information about all aspects of a node.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3650](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3650).

#### Implement context backends for the contextualizer

The closed-source `context` plugin offers a backend functionality for
finding matches between data sets.

The new `lookup-table` built-in is a hashtable-based
contextualization algorithm that enriches events based on a unique value.

The JSON format has a new `--arrays-of-objects` parameter that allows for
parsing a JSON array of JSON objects into an event for each object.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#3684](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3684).

#### Add 'min_events' parameters to /serve endpoint

We optimized the behavior of the 'serve' operator to respond
quicker and cause less system load for pipelines that take a
long time to generate the first result. The new `min_events`
parameter can be used to implement long-polling behavior for
clients of `/serve`.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#3666](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3666).

#### Support comments in xsv parser

Use `--allow-comments` with the `xsv` parser (incl. `csv`, `tsv`, and `ssv`)
to treat lines beginning with `'#'` as comments.

By [@eliaskosunen](https://github.com/eliaskosunen) in [#3681](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3681).

#### Add `export --internal` to access metrics

The new `--internal` flag for the `export` operators returns internal events
collected by the system, for example pipeline metrics.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#3619](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3619).

### Changes

#### Rename pytenzir to tenzir

We renamed the name of our python package from `pytenzir` to `tenzir`.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#3660](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3660).

#### Implement a TCP loader

We renamed the `--bind` option of the `zmq` connector
to `--listen`.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3664](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3664).

#### Consider discard, export, and import as internal operators

Ingress and egress metrics for pipelines now indicate whether the pipeline
sent/received events to/from outside of the node with a new `internal` flag. For
example, when using the `export` operator, data is entering the pipeline from
within the node, so its ingress is considered internal.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3658](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3658).

### Bug Fixes

#### Add `export --internal` to access metrics

`export --live` now respects a subsequent `where <expr>` instead of silently
discarding the filter expression.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#3619](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3619).

#### Support lists and null values and empty strings in XSV parser

The `csv`, `ssv`, and `tsv` parsers now correctly support empty strings, lists,
and null values.

The `tail` operator no longer hangs occasionally.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3687](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3687).

#### Fix `sort` type check

Using the `sort` operator with polymorphic inputs no longer leads to a failing
assertion under some circumstances.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#3655](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3655).
