### Features

#### Add `fill` option to chart operators

The new `fill` option on `chart_area`, `chart_bar` and `chart_line` allows you
to specify a value to replace `null`s with and fill gaps.

#### Fix `from`/`to` not respecting default formats

The `from` and `to` operators now assume `http` and `https` URLs to produce or
accept JSON, unless the filename in the URL contains a known file extension.

#### Fix crash in AMQP and add JSON `arrays_of_objects` option

The `write_json` and `write_ndjson` operators now have a `arrays_of_objects`
option.

### Bug Fixes

#### Fix crash in AMQP and add JSON `arrays_of_objects` option

We fixed a bug in `load_amqp` and `save_amqp` that prevented the node from
starting if they were used in a pipeline configured as code and failed to connect.
