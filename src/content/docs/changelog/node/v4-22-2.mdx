### Features

#### Implement `<list>.sort()` and `<record>.sort()`

The new `sort` method sorts fields in records by name and lists by values.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4704](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4704).

#### Add a `value_counts` aggregation function

The new `value_counts` aggregation function returns a list of values and their
frequency.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4701](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4701).

### Bug Fixes

#### Enable google-cloud-pubsub connector in the Docker Image

The `google-cloud-pubsub` connector and TQL2 operators `load_google_cloud_pubsub`
`save_google_cloud_pubsub` operators are now available in the Docker image.

By [@IyeOnline](https://github.com/IyeOnline) in [#4690](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4690).

#### Add a `value_counts` aggregation function

We fixed a bug that caused the `mode` aggregation function to sometimes ignore
some input values.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4701](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4701).

#### Allow reinstantiating the `buffer` operator

We fixed a bug in the `buffer` operator that caused it to break when
restarting a pipeline or using multiple buffers in a "parallel" context,
such as in `load_tcp`'s pipeline argument.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4702](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4702).

#### Explicitly close ending TCP connection sockets

We fixed a bug that sometimes prevented incoming connections from `load_tcp`
from closing properly.
