### Features

#### PRs 2064-2082

The built-in `select` and `project` transform steps now correctly handle
dropping all rows and columns respectively, effectively deleting the input
data.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#2064](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2064).

#### Add new query language plugin

VAST has a new *query language* plugin type that allows for adding additional
query language frontends. The plugin performs one function: compile user input
into a VAST expression. The new `sigma` plugin demonstrates usage of this plugin
type.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#2074](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2074).

#### Implement a generic aggregation transform step

The new built-in `rename` transform step allows for renaming event types
during a transformation. This is useful when you want to ensure that a
repeatedly triggered transformation does not affect already transformed
events.

The new `aggregate` transform plugin allows for flexibly grouping and
aggregating events. We recommend using it alongside the [`compaction`
plugin](https://vast.io/docs/about/use-cases/data-aging), e.g., for rolling
up events into a more space-efficient representation after a certain amount of
time.

### Changes

#### Correctly handle partition transforms without output

We fixed an issue where partition transforms that erase complete partitions
trigger an internal assertion failure.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#2123](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2123).

#### Log actor names together with the unique actor ID

Actor names in log messages now have an `-ID` suffix to make it easier to tell
multiple instances of the same actor apart, e.g., `exporter-42`.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#2119](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2119).

#### Deprecate the msgpack table slice

The `msgpack` encoding option is now deprecated. VAST issues a warning on
startup and automatically uses the `arrow` encoding instead. A future version of
VAST will remove this option entirely.

The experimental aging feature is now deprecated. The [compaction
plugin](https://vast.io/docs/about/use-cases/data-aging) offers a superset
of the aging functionality.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#2087](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2087).

#### Add new query language plugin

VAST no longer attempts to intepret query expressions as Sigma rules
automatically. Instead, this functionality moved to a dedicated `sigma` query
language plugin that must explicitly be enabled at build time.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#2074](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2074).

### Bug Fixes

#### Improve name lookup in meta index to reduce FPs

A performance bug in the first stage of query evaluation caused VAST to return
too many candidate partitions when querying for a field suffix. For example, a
query for the `ts` field commonly used in Zeek logs also included partitions for
`netflow.pkts` from `suricata.netflow` events. This bug no longer exists,
resulting in a considerable speedup of affected queries.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2086](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2086).

#### Send initial db state to new partition creation listeners

We fixed a bug that potentially resulted in the wrong subset of partitions to be
considered during query evaluation.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#2103](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2103).

#### Fix hanging queries

VAST does not lose query capacity when backlogged queries are cancelled any
more.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#2092](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2092).

#### Adjust index statistics for partition transforms

VAST now correctly adjusts the index statistics when applying partition
transforms.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#2097](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2097).
