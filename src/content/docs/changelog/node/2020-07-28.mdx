Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/releases/tag/2020.07.28).

### Features

#### Add a static binary workflow

Starting with this release, installing VAST on any Linux becomes significantly
easier: A static binary will be provided with each release on the GitHub
releases page.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#966](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/966).

#### Add MsgPack-based Table Slice implementation

We open-sourced our [MessagePack](http://msgpack.org)-based table slice
implementation, which provides a compact row-oriented encoding of data. This
encoding works well for binary formats (e.g., PCAP) and access patterns that
involve materializing entire rows. The MessagePack table slice is the new
default when Apache Arrow is unavailable. To enable parsing into MessagePack,
you can pass `--table-slice-type=msgpack` to the `import` command, or set the
configuration option `import.table-slice-type` to `'msgpack'`.

### Changes

#### Use Flatbuffers for Persistent State of Segment Store and Meta Index

[FlatBuffers](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/) is now a required
 dependency for VAST. The archive and the segment store use FlatBuffers to store
 and version their on-disk persistent state.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#972](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/972).

#### Improve handling of the default schema paths

VAST now recognizes `/etc/vast/schema` as an additional default directory for
schema files.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#980](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/980).

#### PRs 954-986

The suricata schema file contains new type definitions for the stats, krb5, smb,
and ssh events.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#954](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/954).

### Bug Fixes

#### Fix spawn source subcommand

The PCAP reader now correctly shows the amount of generated events.
