Tenzir Node v5.7.0 introduces a new secret type that keeps its sensitive content hidden while enabling flexible secret retrieval. This release also adds support for OCSF extensions and brings several improvements to the  operator.

Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/releases/tag/v5.7.0).

### Features

#### `save_tcp` now reconnects on network outages

The `save_tcp` (`from "tcp://..."`) operator now tries to reconnect in case of recoverable errors such as network outages and in case the remote end disconnects.

You can use the new options `retry_delay: duration` and `max_retry_count: int` to tune the behavior to your needs. The default values are set to 30 seconds and 10 times respectively.

#### Add an option to add extra headers to the platform request

The new option `tenzir.platform-extra-headers` causes the Tenzir Node to add the given extra HTTP headers when
establishing the connection to the Tenzir Platform, for example to pass additional authentication headers
when traversing proxies.

You can set this variable either via configuration file:

```yaml
tenzir:
  platform-extra-headers:
    Authentication: Bearer XXXX
    Proxy-Authentication: Bearer YYYY
```

or as environment variable: (note the double underscore before the name of the header)

```sh
TENZIR_PLATFORM_EXTRA_HEADERS__AUTHENTICATION="Bearer XXXX"
TENZIR_PLATFORM_EXTRA_HEADERS__PROXY_AUTHENTICATION="Bearer YYYY"
```

When using the environment variable version, the Tenzir Node always converts the name of the header to lowercase
and converts underscores to dashes, so a header specified as `TENZIR_PLATFORM_EXTRA_HEADERS__EXTRA_HEADER=extra`
will be sent as `extra-header: extra` in the HTTP request.

#### Support for OCSF extensions

The `ocsf::apply` operator now supports OCSF extensions. This means that
`metadata.extensions` is now also taken into account for casting and validation.
At the moment, only the extensions versioned together with OCSF are supported.
This includes the `win` and `linux` extensions.

#### Enhanced file renaming in `from_file` operator

The `from_file` operator now provides enhanced file renaming capabilities when
using the `rename` parameter. These improvements make file operations more
robust and user-friendly.

**Directory creation**: The operator now automatically creates intermediate
directories when renaming files to paths that don't exist yet. For example, if
you rename a file to `/new/deep/directory/structure/file.txt`, all necessary
parent directories (`/new`, `/new/deep`, `/new/deep/directory`,
`/new/deep/directory/structure`) will be created automatically.

```tql
from_file "/data/*.json", rename=path => f"/processed/by-date/2024/01/{path.file_name()}"
```

**Trailing slash handling**: When the rename target ends with a trailing slash,
the operator now automatically appends the original filename. This makes it easy
to move files to different directories while preserving their names.

```tql
// This will rename "/input/data.json" to "/output/data.json"
from_file "/input/*.json", rename=path => "/output/"
```

Previously, you would have needed to manually extract and append the filename:

```tql
// Old approach - no longer necessary
from_file "/input/*.json", rename=path => f"/output/{path.file_name()}"
```

#### Preserving variants when using `ocsf::apply`

The `ocsf::apply` operator now has an additional `preserve_variants` option,
which makes it so that free-form objects are preserved as-is, instead of being
JSON-encoded. Most notably, this applies to the `unmapped` field. For example,
if `unmapped` is `{x: 42}`, then `ocsf::apply` would normally JSON-encode it so
that it ends up with the value `"{\"x\": 42}"`. If `ocsf::apply
preserve_variants=true` is used instead, then `unmapped` simply stays a record.
Note that this means that the event schema changes whenever the type of
`unmapped` changes.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#5312](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5312).

#### Secrets

Tenzir now features a new first class type: `secret`. As the name suggests, this
type contains a secret value that cannot be accessed by a user:

```tql
from { s: secret("my-secret") }
```
```tql
{
  s: "***", // Does not render the secret value
}
```

A secret is created by the `secret` function, which changes its behavior with this
release.

Operators now accept secrets where appropriate, most notably for username and
password arguments, but also for URLs:

```tql
let $url = "https://" + secret("splunk-host") + ":8088"
to_splunk $url, hec_token=secret("splunk-hec-token")
```

However, a `string` is implicitly convertible to a `secret` in an operator
argument, meaning that you do not have to configure a secret if you are fine
with just a string literal:

```tql
to_splunk "https://localhost:8088", hec_token="my-plaintext-token"
```

Along with this feature in the Tenzir Node, we introduced secret stores to the
Tenzir Platform. You can now centrally manage secrets in the platform, which
will usable by all nodes within the workspace. Read more about this in the
release notes for the Tenzir Platform and our Explanations page on secrets.

### Changes

#### The `secret` function returns secrets

The `secret` function now returns a `secret`, the strong type introduced in this
release. Previously it returned a plaintext `string`. This change protects
secrets from being leaked, as only operators can resolve secrets now.

If you want to retain the old behavior , you can enable the configuration option
`tenzir.legacy-secret-model`. In this mode, the `secret` function can only
resolve secrets from the Tenzir Node's configuration file and not access any
external secret store.

#### Kafka operators now automatically configure SASL mechanism for AWS IAM

The `load_kafka` and `save_kafka` operators now automatically set
`sasl.mechanism` option to the expected `OAUTHBEARER` when using the `aws_iam`
option. If the mechanism has already been set to a different value, an error is
emitted.

#### TQL2 support in compaction plugin

The pipelines defined as part of the compaction configuration can now use TQL2.
For backwards-compatibility, TQL1 pipelines still work, but they are deprecated
and emit a warning on start-up.

### Bug Fixes

#### Fixed shutdown hang during storage optimization

Nodes periodically merge and optimize their storage over time. We fixed a hang
on shutdown for nodes while this process was ongoing.

By [@IyeOnline](https://github.com/IyeOnline) in [#5301](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5301).

#### `from_file` with a per-file sink

The `from_file` operator no longer fails when its per-file pipeline argument is
a sink. Before this fix, the following pipeline which opens a new TCP connection
per file would not work:

```tql
from_file "./*.csv" {
  read_csv
  write_ndjson
  save_tcp "localhost:8080"
}
```
