### Features

#### Implement `if … else` expressions and short-circuiting for `and` / `or`

Tenzir now supports inline `if … else` expressions in the form `foo if pred`,
which returns `foo` if `pred` evaluates to `true`, or `null` otherwise, and `foo
if pred else bar`, which instead of falling back to `null` falls back to `bar`.

#### Implement `from_opensearch`

We added a `from_opensearch` operator that presents a OpenSearch-compatible REST
API to enable easy interop with tools that can send data to OpenSearch or
Elasticsearch, e.g. Filebeat, Winlogbeat etc.

#### Implement `write_syslog`

We added a new `write_syslog` operator to format events as syslog messages.

### Bug Fixes

#### Implement `if … else` expressions and short-circuiting for `and` / `or`

The binary operators `and` and `or` now skip evaluating their right-hand side
when not necessary. For example, `where this.has("foo") and foo == 42` now
avoids emitting a warning when `foo` does not exist.

#### Hardcode the fluent-bit page size to 24576

The `from_fluent_bit` and `to_fluent_bit` operators no longer crash when trying
to handle very large payloads.
