### Features

#### Add label definitions to configured pipelines

Pipelines configured as code in the `tenzir.yaml` configuration file may now
contain labels.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#4247](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4247).

#### Add an option for writing JSON arrays of objects

Use `write json --arrays-of-objects` to write JSON arrays per batch of events
instead of JSON objects per event.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4249](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4249).

#### Build an RPM package

We now offer an RPM package for RedHat Linux and its derivatives.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#4188](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4188).

#### Support multiple fields in `sort`

The `sort` operator now supports sorting by multiple fields.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4242](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4242).

#### Add an option to `export` both past and future events

The `export`, `metrics`, and `diagnostics` operators now features a `--retro`
flag. This flag will make the operators first export past events, even when
`--live` is set. Specify both options explicitly to first return past events and
then immediately switch into live mode.

By [@IyeOnline](https://github.com/IyeOnline) in [#4203](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4203).

#### Allow editing definitions of managed pipelines

The `/pipeline/update` API endpoint now supports updating definitions of
existing pipelines.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#4196](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4196).

#### Support IP-in-subnet queries in lookup tables

The `lookup-table` context now performs longest-prefix matches when the table
key is of type `subnet` and the to-be-enriched field of type `ip`. For example,
a lookup table with key `10.0.0.0/8` will match when enriching the IP address
`10.1.1.1`.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#4051](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4051).

#### Support disabling TLS in `https` connector

The `https` connector supports the new options `--skip-peer-verification` and
`--skip-hostname-verification` to disable verification of the peer's certificate
and verification of the certificate hostname.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#4248](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4248).

### Bug Fixes

#### Support multiple table slice schemas when dumping contexts

`context inspect` will not crash anymore when encountering contexts that
contain multi-schema data.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#4236](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4236).

#### Add an option to `export` both past and future events

`export --live` no longer buffers the last batch of event that was imported, and
instead immediately returns all imported events.

By [@IyeOnline](https://github.com/IyeOnline) in [#4203](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4203).

#### Add label definitions to configured pipelines

Pipelines configured as code no longer always restart with the node. Instead,
just like for other pipelines, they only restart when they were running before
the node shut down.
