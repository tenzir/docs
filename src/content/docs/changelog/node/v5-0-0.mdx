This release is packed with new features, bug fixes, and performance
improvements.

## Changes

### Improved changelog

As part of moving our docs site, we are also improving our changelog handling.
The new `tenzir/docs` repo will receive changelog entries from all of our other
repos and host an amalgamated changelog.

## Bug Fixes

### Fix broken changelog generation

We had a bug in our changelog generation that nobody knew about. We fixed it and
moved on.
