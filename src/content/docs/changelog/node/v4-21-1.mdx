### Features

#### Make the grok parser precise

The `grok` parser now allows better control over the schema inference.

The `grok` parser can now be directly used when reading input, allowing for
`read grok`.

#### Add `sample` operator

A new `sample` operator now provides the ability to dynamically sample input
data based on the frequency of the receiving events allowing relative sampling
in situations of varying load.

### Bug Fixes

#### Switch the index to basic messaging

We fixed a bug that sometimes caused the `tenzir-node` process to hang on
shutdown. This was most likely to happen when the node shut down immediately
after starting up, e.g., because of an invalid configuration file.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#4613](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4613).

#### Fix double-closing fds in the python operator

Fixed a bug in the python operator that could lead to random valid file
descriptors in the parent process being closed prematurely.

#### Enable azure-blob-storage in the DEB and RPM packages

The `azure-blob-storage` connector is now also available in the static linux
binary distributions.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#4649](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4649).

#### Fix incorrect context updates count in lookup metrics

We fixed a bug that caused the `context_updates` field in `metrics lookup` to be
reported once per field specified in the corresponding `lookup` operator instead
of being reported once per operator in total.
