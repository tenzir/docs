### Changes

#### Update the submodule pointers to include periodic platform reconnects

Tenzir nodes no longer attempt reconnecting to app.tenzir.com immediately upon
failure, but rather wait before reconnecting.

### Bug Fixes

#### Ignore events in `lookup` that did not bind

The `lookup` operator no longer tries to match internal metrics and diagnostics
events.

The `lookup` operator no longer returns events for which none of the provided
fields exist.
