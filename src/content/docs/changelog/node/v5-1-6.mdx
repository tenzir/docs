This release adds the ability to extract hour, minute, and day components from
timestamps.

Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/releases/tag/v5.1.6).

### Features

#### Add `hour`, `minute`, and `second` time component extraction

The `hour`, `minute`, and `second` functions extract the respective components
of a `time` value, and compliment the existing `year`, `month`, and `day`
functions. The `second` function includes subsecond precision.

#### Add prototype for static platform config

Users of the Sovereign Edition of Tenzir can now use
workspace tokens to connect their Tenzir Nodes to the
Tenzir Platform.

### Changes

#### Remove deprecated `as_secs()` function

We removed the deprecated `<duration>.as_secs()` function which has been
superseded by `<duration>.count_seconds()` quite some time ago. The
`count_seconds()` function provides the same functionality with a more
consistent naming convention that aligns with other duration-related functions
like `count_minutes()`, `count_hours()`, etc.

### Bug Fixes

#### Fix a hang in `if` for stalled inputs

We fixed a regression in the `if` statement that caused it to indefinitely
withhold the last batch of events when its input stalled.

#### Handle assert gracefully in `write_syslog`

We now gracefully handle a panic in `write_syslog`, when `structured_data` does
not have the expected shape.
