### Features

#### Add `to_opensearch` and `to_elasticsearch` sink operators

A new operator `to_opensearch` is now available for sending data to
OpenSearch-compatible Bulk API providers including ElasticSearch.

By [@raxyte](https://github.com/raxyte) in [#4871](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4871).

#### Add `duration(string) -> duration`

The new `duration` function now allows to parse expressions
resulting in strings as duration values.

By [@raxyte](https://github.com/raxyte) in [#4877](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4877).

#### Introduce a TQL2-only mode

Start your Tenzir Node with `tenzir-node --tql2` or set the `TENZIR_TQL2=true`
environment variable to enable TQL2-only mode for your node. In this mode, all
pipelines will run as TQL2, with the old TQL1 pipelines only being available
through the `legacy` operator. In Q1 2025, this option will be enabled by
default, and later in 2025 the `legacy` operator and TQL1 support will be
removed entirely.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4840](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4840).

#### Parse `x not in y` as `not x in y`

TQL2 now allows writing `x not in y` as an equivalent to `not (x in y)` for
better readability.

By [@raxyte](https://github.com/raxyte) in [#4844](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4844).

#### Implement `ip in subnet` and `subnet in subnet`

Whether an IP address is contained in a subnet can now be checked using
expressions such as `1.2.3.4 in 1.2.0.0/16`. Similarly, to check whether a
subnet is included in another subnet, use `1.2.0.0/16 in 1.0.0.0/8`.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#4841](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4841).

#### Implement TQL2 `from` and `to`

We have added the `from` operator that allows you to easily onboard data from
most sources.
For example, you can now write `from "https://example.com/file.json.gz"`
to automatically deduce the load operator, compression, and format.

We have added the `to` operator that allows you to easily send data to most
destinations.
For example, you can now write `to "ftps://example.com/file.json.gz"`
to automatically deduce the save operator, compression, and format.

You can use the new `subnet(string)` function to parse strings as subnets.

By [@IyeOnline](https://github.com/IyeOnline) in [#4805](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4805).

#### Enhance HTTP connector controls

Several new options are now available for the `load_http` operator: `data`,
`json`, `form`, `skip_peer_verification`, `skip_hostname_verification`,
`chunked`, and `multipart`. The `skip_peer_verification` and
`skip_hostname_verification` options are now also available for the `save_http`
operator.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#4811](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4811).

#### Custom quotes and doubled quote escaping

The `read_csv`, `read_kv`, `read_ssv`, `read_tsv` and `read_xsv` operators now
support custom quote characters.

The `read_csv`, `read_ssv`, `read_tsv` and `read_xsv` operators support doubled
quote escaping.

The `read_csv`, `read_ssv`, `read_tsv` and `read_xsv` operators now accept
multi-character strings as separators.

The `list_sep` option for the `read_csv`, `read_ssv`, `read_tsv` and `read_xsv`
operators can be set to an empty string, which will disable list parsing.

The new `string.parse_leef()` function can be used to parse a string as a LEEF
message.

By [@IyeOnline](https://github.com/IyeOnline) in [#4837](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4837).

#### Add Snowflake sink

We have added a new `to_snowflake` sink operator, writing events into a
[snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/) table.

By [@IyeOnline](https://github.com/IyeOnline) in [#4589](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4589).

#### Implement `float(number|string)`

Numbers and string expressions containing numbers can now be converted into
`float` type values using the `float` function.

By [@raxyte](https://github.com/raxyte) in [#4882](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4882).

#### Port `deduplicate` to TQL2

The `deduplicate` operator in TQL2 to help you remove events with a common key.
The operator provides more flexibility than its TQL1 pendant by letting the
common key use any expression, not just a field name. You can also control
timeouts with finer granularity.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4850](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4850).

#### Add user-defined operators to TQL2

User-defined operators can now be written and used in TQL2. To use TQL2, start
your definition with the comment `// tql2`, or use the `--tql2` flag to opt into
TQL2 as the default.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#4884](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4884).

#### Implement `context::erase`

The `context::erase` operator allows you to selectively remove entries from
contexts.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4864](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4864).

#### `save_email` cleanup

The `save_email` now accepts a `tls` option to specify TLS usage when establishing
the SMTP connection.

By [@raxyte](https://github.com/raxyte) in [#4848](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4848).

### Changes

#### Split `compress`/`decompress` into separate operators

The `compress` and `decompress` operators have been deprecated in favor of
separate operators for each compression algorithm. These new operators expose
additional options, such as `compress_gzip level=10, format="deflate"`.

By [@IyeOnline](https://github.com/IyeOnline) in [#4876](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4876).

#### Make the expression evaluator support heterogeneous results

Functions can now return values of different types for the same input types. For
example, `x.otherwise(y)` no longer requires that `x` has the same type as `y`.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#4839](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4839).

#### Implement TQL2 `from` and `to`

The `topic` argument for `load_kafka` and `save_kafka` is now a positional
argument, instead of a named argument.

The array version of `from` that allowed you to create multiple events has been
removed. Instead, you can just pass multiple records to `from` now.

By [@IyeOnline](https://github.com/IyeOnline) in [#4805](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4805).

### Bug Fixes

#### Fix operator parenthesis continuation

Operator invocations that directly use parenthesis but continue after the
closing parenthesis are no longer rejected. For example, `where (x or y) and z`
is now being parsed correctly.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#4885](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4885).

#### Fix handling of empty records in `write_parquet`

`write_parquet` now gracefully handles nested empty records by replacing them
with nulls. The Apache Parquet format does fundamentally not support empty
nested records.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4874](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4874).

#### Make the expression evaluator support heterogeneous results

Metadata such as `@name` can now be set to a dynamically computed value that
does not have to be a constant. For example, if the field `event_name` should be
used as the event name, `@name = event_name` now correctly assigns the events
their name instead of using the first value.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#4839](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4839).

#### `save_email` cleanup

The `endpoint` argument of the `save_email` operator was documented as optional
but was not parsed as so. This has been fixed and the argument is now
correctly optional.

By [@raxyte](https://github.com/raxyte) in [#4848](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4848).

#### Fix pipeline manager discarding parse-time warnings

Warnings that happen very early during pipeline startup now correctly show up in
the Tenzir Platform.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#4867](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4867).

#### Validate legacy expressions when splitting for predicate pushdown

Pipelines that begin with `export | where` followed by an expression that does
not depend on the incoming events, such as `export | where 1 == 1`, no longer
cause an internal error.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#4861](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4861).
