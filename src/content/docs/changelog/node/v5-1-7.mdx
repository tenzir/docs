This release adds the ability to disable entire packages.

Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/releases/tag/v5.1.7).

### Features

#### Allow packages to be disabled properly

Packages gained a new `config.disabled` option that causes all pipelines and
contexts in the package to be disabled.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#5161](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5161).

#### Add option to `load_tcp` for storing sender information

The `peer_field` option for `load_tcp` allows for setting a field for the IP
address, port, and hostname of the connected peer.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#5173](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5173).

#### Implement `<record>.keys()`

The `keys` function returns a list of strings representing the field names of a
record.

### Bug Fixes

#### Make the run loop of exec nodes cheaper

Fixed a bug in the `load_tcp` operator that would
cause it to require server certificates for incoming
connections.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#5193](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5193).

#### Allow packages to be disabled properly

For configured pipelines, the `tenzir.pipelines.<pipeline>.disabled`
configuration option was silently ignored unless the pipeline was part of a
package. This no longer happens, and disabling the pipelines through the option
now works correctly.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#5161](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5161).

#### Fix URL check in `to_hive`

The `to_hive` operator no longer incorrectly rejects URLs, which was due to a
bug introduced by Tenzir v5.1.6.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#5204](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5204).
