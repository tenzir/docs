## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Fix a logic error for retried requests in `/serve`

The `/serve` endpoint now gracefully handles retried requests with the same
continuation token, returning the same result for each request.

### Remove the delay between importing and exporting events

We fixed a bug where the `export`, `metrics`, and `diagnostics` operators were
sometimes missing events from up to the last 30 seconds. In the Tenzir Platform,
this showed itself as a gap in activity sparkbars upon loading the page.
