Tenzir Node v5.3.1 updated the pyproject version but did not actually commit it, causing  operator to fail to start. This release fixes the issue.

Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/releases/tag/v5.3.2).

### Bug Fixes

#### Fix `python` operator

Tenzir Node v5.3.0 contained a mismatched version of the Python operator,
causing the operator to fail to start. This no longer happens.
