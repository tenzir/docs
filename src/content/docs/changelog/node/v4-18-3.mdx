### Changes

#### Prevent unbounded memory usage in `export --live`

`metrics export` now includes an additional field that shows the number of
queued events in the pipeline.

### Bug Fixes

#### Use `append_array_slice` everywhere

Fixed an issue where `null` records were sometimes transformed into non-null
records with `null` fields.

We fixed an issue that sometimes caused `subscribe` to fail when multiple
`publish` operators pushed to the same topic at the exact same time.

#### Prevent unbounded memory usage in `export --live`

We fixed a bug that caused a potentially unbounded memory usage in `export
--live`, `metrics --live`, and `diagnostics --live`.
