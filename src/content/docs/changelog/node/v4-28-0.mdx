## Features

### Implement `parse_syslog`

You can use the new `parse_syslog` function to parse a string as a syslog message.

By [@IyeOnline](https://github.com/IyeOnline) in [#4980](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4980).

### Add explicit `tls` options to `to_opensearch` and `to_splunk`

`to_opensearch` and `to_splunk` now feature an explicit `tls` option.

By [@IyeOnline](https://github.com/IyeOnline) in [#4983](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4983).

### More parsing functions

It is now possible to define additional patterns in the `parse_grok` function.

The `read_xsv` family of parsers now accept the `header` as a list of strings as
an alternative to a single delimited string.

`read_grok` now accepts additional `pattern_definitions` as either a `record`
mapping from pattern name to definition or a `string` of newline separated
patterns definitions.

We introduced the `parse_csv`, `parse_kv`, `parse_ssv`, `parse_tsv`, `parse_xsv` and
`parse_yaml` functions, allowing you to parse strings as those formats.

The `map` function now handles cases where list elements mapped to different types.

By [@IyeOnline](https://github.com/IyeOnline) in [#4933](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4933).

### Implement `load_stdin` and `save_stdout`

The new `load_stdin` operator accepts bytes from standard input, while `save_stdout`
writes bytes to standard output.

By [@IyeOnline](https://github.com/IyeOnline) in [#4969](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4969).

## Changes

### Stop collecting metrics for hidden pipelines

`metrics "operator"` no longer includes metrics from hidden pipelines, such as
pipelines run under-the-hood by the Tenzir Platform.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4966](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4966).

### Evict old caches when exceeding capacity limits

Unless specified explicitly, the `cache` has no more default capacity in terms
of number of events per cache. Instead, the node now tracks the global cache
capacity in number of bytes. This is limited to 1GiB by default, and can be
configured with the `tenzir.cache.capacity` option. For practical reasons, we
require at least 64MiB of caches.

The default `write_timeout` of caches increased from 1 minute to 10 minutes, and
can now be configured with the `tenzir.cache.lifetime` option.

The `/serve` endpoint now returns an additional field `state`, which can be one
of `running`, `completed`, or `failed`, indicating the status of the pipeline
with the corresponding `serve` operator at the time of the request.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4984](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4984).

## Bug Fixes

### More parsing functions

Re-defining a predefined grok pattern no longer terminates the application.

The `string.parse_json()` function can now parse single numbers or strings instead
of only objects.

`read_leef` and `parse_leef` now include the `event_class_id` in their output.

`read_yaml` now properly parses numbers as numbers.

By [@IyeOnline](https://github.com/IyeOnline) in [#4933](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4933).

### Fix shutdown of the lookup helper actor

We sqashed a bug that prevented the `tenzir-node` process from exiting cleanly
while the `lookup` operator was used in a pipeline.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#4978](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4978).

### Evict old caches when exceeding capacity limits

We fixed an up to 60 seconds hang in requests to the `/serve` endpoint when the
request was issued after the pipeline with the corresponding `serve` operator
was started and before it finished with an error and without results.
