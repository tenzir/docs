### Features

#### Add an optional `name` argument to the `metrics` operator

The `metrics` operator now optionally takes a metric name as an argument. For
example, `metrics cpu` only shows CPU metrics. This is functionally equivalent
to `metrics | where #schema == "tenzir.metrics.cpu"`.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4369](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4369).

#### Introduce API metrics

The new `tenzir.metrics.api` metrics record every API call made to a Tenzir
Node.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4368](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4368).

#### Emit connection status metrics from the platform

The `tenzir.metrics.platform` metrics records every second whether the
connection to the Tenzir Platform is working as expected from the node's
perspective.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4374](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4374).

#### PRs 4339-4365

The `publish`, `subscribe`, `import`, `export`, `lookup` and `enrich` operators
deliver their own, operator-specific metrics now.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#4339](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4339).

### Changes

#### Raise the default and max timeouts for `/serve`

We raised the default and maximum long-polling timeouts for `/serve` from 2s and
5s to 5s and 10s, respectively.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4370](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4370).

#### Prepare the pipeline manager for TQLv2

Diagnostics from managed pipelines are now deduplicated, showing each diagnostic
at most once for each run.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#4348](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4348).

#### Push expressions into `subscribe` for better metrics

Pipeline activity for pipelines starting with `subscribe | where <expr>` will no
longer report ingress that does not match the provided filter expression.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4349](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4349).

#### Revamp the `export` operator

The previously deprecated `--low-priority` option for the `export` operator no
longer exists. The new `--parallel <level>` option allows tuning how many
worker threads the operator uses at most for querying persisted events.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4365](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4365).

#### Simplify the node actor setup

The deprecated `vast` symlink for the `tenzir-ctl` binary that offeres backwards
compatiblity with versions older than Tenzir v4—when it was called VAST—no
longer exists.

The deprecated `tenzir.db-directory` option no longer exists. Use
`tenzir.state-directory` instead.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4343](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4343).

### Bug Fixes

#### Add missing time format specifiers for the static binary

The time parser now accepts the `%F`, `%g`, `%G`, `%u`, `%V`, `%z`, and `%Z`
format specifiers.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#4366](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4366).

#### Fix open partition tracking in the `lookup` operator

We fixed a rare bug that caused the `lookup` operator to exit unexpectedly when
using a high value for the operator's `--parallel` option.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4363](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4363).

#### Allow immediate restarts of the TCP listen connector

The `tcp` connector no longer fails in listen mode when you try to restart it
directly after stopping it.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#4367](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4367).

#### Honor proxy settings in the SQS connector

The SQS connector now honors system proxy settings.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#4359](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4359).

#### Fix possible crash when one of multiple subscribers disconnects

We fixed a rare crash when one of multiple `subscribe` operators for the same
topic disconnected while at least one of the other subscribers was overwhelmed
and asked for corresponding publishers to throttle.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4346](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4346).

#### Remove the zero-size check in the split_at_null() input loop

We fixed a rarely occurring issue in the `gelf` parser that led to parsing
errors for some events.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#4341](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4341).

#### Push expressions into `subscribe` for better metrics

Pipelines of the form `export --live | where <expr>` failed to filter with
type extractors or concepts. This now works as expected.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4349](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4349).
