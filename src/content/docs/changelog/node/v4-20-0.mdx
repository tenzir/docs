### Features

#### Perform individual catalog lookups in `lookup`

The `lookup` operator is now smarter about retroactive lookups for frequently
updated contexts and avoids loading data from disk multiple times for context
updates that arrive shortly after one another.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4535](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4535).

#### Implement the `cache` operator

The `cache` operator is a transformation that passes through events, creating an
in-memory cache of events on the first use. On subsequent uses, the operator
signals upstream operators no to start at all, and returns the cached events
immediately. The operator may also be used as a source for reading from a cache
only, or as a sink for writing to a cache only.

The `/pipeline/launch` operator features four new parameters `cache_id`,
`cache_capacity`,`cache_ttl`, and `cache_max_ttl`. If a `cache_id` is specified,
the pipeline's implicit sink will use the `cache` operator under the hood. At
least one of `serve_id` and `cache_id` must be specified.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4515](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4515).

#### Remove the legacy metrics system

The new `rebuild` metrics contain information about running partition rebuilds.

The `ingest` metrics contain information about all ingested events and their
schema. This is slightly different from the existing `import` metrics, which
track only events imported via the `import` operator, and are separate per
pipeline.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4381](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4381).

#### Implement unstoppable pipelines

The new `unstoppable` flag allows for pipelines to run and repeat indefinitely
without the ability to stop or pause.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#4513](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4513).

### Changes

#### Remove the legacy metrics system

The previously deprecated legacy metrics system configured via the
`tenzir.metrics` configuration section no longer exists. Use the `metrics`
operator instead.

`lookup` metrics no longer contain the `snapshot` field; instead, the values
show in the `retro` field.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4381](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4381).

#### Remove special character escaping from `lines_printer`

The `lines` printer now does not perform any escaping and is no longer an alias to
the `ssv` printer. Additionally, nulls are skipped, instead of being printed
as `-`.

By [@raxyte](https://github.com/raxyte) in [#4520](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4520).

#### PRs 4455-4549

The `show` operator is deprecated. Use the operator `<aspect>` instead of `show
<aspect>`. The information from `show dependencies` and `show build` is now
available in the `version` operator.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4455](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4455).

### Bug Fixes

#### Fix a crash when starting `export` on shutdown

We fixed an issue where the `export`, `metrics`, or `diagnostics` operators
crashed the node when started while the node was shutting down or after an
unexpected filesystem error occurred. This happened frequently while using the
Tenzir Platform, which subscribes to metrics and diagnostics automatically.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4530](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4530).

#### Perform individual catalog lookups in `lookup`

We fixed a bug that sometimes caused the `retro.queued_events` value in `lookup`
metrics to stop going down again.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4535](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4535).

#### Fix data parser precedence

IPv6 addresses with a prefix that is a valid duration, for example `2dff::` with
the prefix `2d`, now correctly parse as an IP instead of a string.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#4523](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4523).

#### Fix regression in `azure-log-analytics`

We fixed a regression introduced in Tenzir v4.19.2 in the `azure-log-analytics`
operator that prevented it from starting correctly.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4516](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4516).

#### Fix crash for heterogeneous subnet lookup tables

`context inspect <ctx>` no longer crashes for lookup table contexts with
values of multiple schemas when using subnets as keys.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4531](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4531).
