This release introduces payload compression for Azure Log Analytics to reduce bandwidth usage, as well as an important fix for a `from_http` bug that was introduced with the previous release.

Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/releases/tag/v5.11.1).

### Changes

#### `to_azure_log_analytics` compression

The `to_azure_log_analytics` operator now compresses the sent payload,
significantly reducing the bandwidth consumed.

### Bug Fixes

#### Fixed `from_http` default port

Using the `from_http` operator as a client without explicitly specifying a port
resulted in an error complaining that the port cannot be zero. This now works as
expected, meaning that the default port is derived correctly from the URL
scheme, i.e., 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS.
