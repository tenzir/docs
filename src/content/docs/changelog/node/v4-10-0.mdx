### Features

#### Fix partial specialization of S3 configuration in URL

S3 access and secret keys can now be specified in the S3 plugin's configuration
file.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4001](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4001).

#### Add configurable pipelines

We made it possible to set pipelines declaratively in the `tenzir.yaml`
configuration file.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#4006](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4006).

#### Allow using `and`, `or`, and `not` in expressions

The `where` operator now supports using `and`, `or`, and `not` as alternatives
to `&&`, `||`, and `!` in expressions.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3993](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3993).

#### Introduce multi-arch Docker images

The `tenzir/tenzir` and `tenzir/tenzir-node` Docker images now run natively on
arm64 in addition to amd64.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3989](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3989).

#### Implement multi-field lookups for context implementations

The `enrich` and `lookup` operators now support type extractors, concepts, and
comma-separated lists of fields as arguments to `--field`.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#3968](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3968).

### Changes

#### Improve metrics collection

Nodes now collect CPU, disk, memory, and process metrics every second instead of
every ten seconds, improving the usability of metrics with the `chart` operator.
Memory metrics now work as expected on macOS.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3982](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3982).

#### Introduce the `no-location-overrides` option

We've replaced the `tenzir.allow-unsafe-pipelines` option with the
`tenzir.no-location-overrides` option with an inverted default. The new option
is a less confusing default for new users and more accurately describes what the
option does, namely preventing operator locations to be overriden.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3978](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3978).

### Bug Fixes

#### Count nulls and absent values in `top` and `rare`

The `top` and `rare` operators now correctly count null and absent values.
Previously, they emitted a single event with a count of zero when any null or
absent values were included in the input.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3990](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3990).

#### Fix a TOCTOU bug that caused the index to fail

Tenzir nodes sometimes failed when trying to canonicalize file system paths
before opening them when the disk-monitor or compaction rotated them out. This
is now handled gracefully.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3994](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3994).

#### Fix partial specialization of S3 configuration in URL

The S3 connector no longer ignores the default credentials provider for the
current user when any arguments are specified in the URI explicitly.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4001](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4001).

#### Fix panic on parsing invalid syslog messages

Parsing an invalid syslog message (using the schema `syslog.unknown`)
no longer causes a crash.

By [@eliaskosunen](https://github.com/eliaskosunen) in [#4012](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4012).

#### Make `remote python` work

The `python` operator now works with when using the `remote` location override.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3999](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3999).

#### Prevent tcp socket inheritance to child processes

We fixed a problem with the TCP connector that caused pipeline restarts on the
same port to fail if running `shell` or `python` operators were present.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#3998](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3998).

#### Fix crash in `sigma` operator for non-existent file

The `sigma` operator sometimes crashed when pointed to a non-existent file or
directory. This no longer happens.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4010](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4010).
