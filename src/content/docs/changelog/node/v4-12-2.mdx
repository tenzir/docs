### Features

#### Add an operator for dumping schemas

The chart operator now accepts the flags `--x-axis-type` and `--y-axis-type`
for `bar`, `line`, and `area` charts, with the possible values being `log` and
`linear`, with `linear` as the default value. Setting these flags defines the
scale (logarithmic or linear) on the Tenzir App chart visualization.

### Bug Fixes

#### Use consistent attributes for y-axis in `chart`

The `chart` operator failed to render a chart when the y-axis was not specified
explicitly and the events contained more than two top-level fields. This no
longer happens.

#### Find syntax errors before record batch reading

The python operator now checks for syntax errors on operator start up.

#### Fix reopening ports while subprocesses are open

We fixed a bug that prevented restarts of pipelines containing a listening
connector under specific circumstances.

#### Chain the execution node start response promise to the node lifetime

The retry delay now works for pipelines that fail during startup.

#### Restore implicit `read json` in `from tcp`

We accidentally removed the implicit `read json` from `from tcp` in Tenzir
v4.12. The shortform now works as expected again.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4175](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4175).

#### Fix shutdown of `every <interval> <transformation|sink>`

Transformations or sinks used with the `every` operator modifier did not shut
down correctly when exhausting their input. This now work as expected.
