### Features

#### Make `show pipelines` a thing

The new `show pipelines` aspect displays a list of all managed pipelines.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#3457](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3457).

#### Bump the tenzir-plugins submodule pointer to include the pipeline manager's failure and rendered diagnostics functionality

The `rendered` field in the pipeline manager diagnostics delivers a displayable
version of the diagnostic's error message.

Pipelines that encounter an error during execution are now in a new `failed`
rather than `stopped` state.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#3479](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3479).

#### Introduce an experimental `sigma` operator

The new `sigma` operator filters its input with Sigma rules and outputs matching
events alongside the matched rule.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3138](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3138).

#### Implement `compress` and `decompress` operators

The `compress [--level <level>] <codec>` and `decompress <codec>` operators
enable streaming compression and decompression in pipelines for `brotli`, `bz2`,
`gzip`, `lz4`, and `zstd`.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3443](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3443).

#### Bump the tenzir-plugins submodule pointer to include the pipeline manager's resuming and pausing functionality

The `pause` action in the `/pipeline/update` endpoint suspends a pipeline and
sets its state to `paused`. Resume it with the `start` action.

Newly created pipelines are now in a new `created` rather than `stopped` state.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#3471](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3471).

#### Implement `show config`

The `show config` aspect returns the configuration currently in use, combining
options set in the configuration file, the command-line, environment options.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3455](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3455).

### Changes

#### Refactor `show` aspects and rewrite `version`

The `version` operator no longer exists. Use `show version` to get the Tenzir
version instead. The additional information that `version` produced is now
available as `show build`, `show dependencies`, and `show plugins`.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#3442](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3442).

### Bug Fixes

#### Tweak the execution node behavior

Pipeline operators that create output independent of their input now emit their
output instantly instead of waiting for receiving further input. This makes the
`shell` operator more reliable.

The `show <aspect>` operator wrongfully required unsafe pipelines to be allowed
for some aspects. This is now fixed.
