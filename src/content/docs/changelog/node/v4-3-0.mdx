### Features

#### Add support for reading and writing YAML documents

The `yaml` format supports reading and writing YAML documents and streams.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3456](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3456).

#### PRs 3461-fluent-bit

The new `fluent-bit` source and sink operator provide and interface to the
Fluent Bit ecosystem. The source operator maps to a Fluent Bit *input* and the
sink operator to a Fluent Bit *output*.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#3461](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3461).

#### Add pipeline label support to the main repository

The pipeline manager now supports user-provided labels for pipelines.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#3541](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3541).

#### Improve `json` parser, add `null` type, and various fixes

The performance of the `json`, `suricata` and `zeek-json` parsers was improved.

The `json` parser has a new `--raw` flag, which uses the raw type of JSON values
instead of trying to infer one. For example, strings with ip addresses are given
the type `string` instead of `ip`.

A dedicated `null` type was added.

Empty records are now allowed. Operators that previously discarded empty records
(for example, `drop`) now preserve them.

### Changes

#### Disable dense indexes

Tenzir no longer builds dense indexes for imported events. Dense indexes
improved query performance at the cost of a higher memory usage. However, over
time the performance improvement became smaller due to other improvements in the
underlying storage engine.

Tenzir no longer supports models in taxonomies. Since Tenzir v4.0 they were only
supported in the deprecated `tenzir-ctl export` and `tenzir-ctl count` commands.
We plan to bring the functionality back in the future with more powerful
expressions in TQL.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3552](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3552).

#### Disable 0mq socket lingering

We made it easier to reuse the default `zmq` socket endpoint by disabling
*socket lingering*, and thereby immediately relinquishing resources when
terminating a ZeroMQ pipeline. Changing the linger period from infinite to 0 no
longer buffers pending messages in memory after closing a ZeroMQ socket.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#3536](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3536).

### Bug Fixes

#### Fix timing-related crashes in the `web` plugin

The web server will not crash when receiving requests during shutdown anymore.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#3553](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3553).

#### Change type of `version` in `suricata.quic` to `string`

The type of the `quic.version` field in the built-in `suricata.quic` schema was
fixed. It now is a string instead of an integer.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#3533](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3533).

#### Implement serialization_plugins for store_plugins

The `parquet` and `feather` formats no longer throw assertions during normal
usage anymore.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#3537](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3537).

#### Fix the wrong type for the version record type in the `zeek.software` schema

The `zeek.software` does not contain an incomplete `version` record type
anymore.

The `version.minor` type in the `zeek.software` schema is now a `uint64`
instead of a `double` to comply with Zeek's version structure.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#3538](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3538).

#### Improve `json` parser, add `null` type, and various fixes

The `json`, `suricata` and `zeek-json` parsers are now more stable and should
now parse all inputs correctly.

`null` records are no longer incorrectly transformed into records with `null`
fields anymore.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#3503](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3503).

#### Fix processing of http arguments

The `http` loader no longer ignores the value user-provided custom headers.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#3535](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3535).
