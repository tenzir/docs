This release brings forth stability improvements under high load that could cause platform unresponsiveness, fixes API request isolation problems, better kafka diagnostics and more.

Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/releases/tag/v5.16.0).

### Features

#### Subscribe to multiple topics at once

The `subscribe` operator now accepts multiple topics to subscribe to. For
example, `subscribe "notices", "alerts"` subscribes to both the `notices`, and
the `alerts` topic. This makes it easier to build pipelines that join multiple
topics back together.

#### `from_gcs` operator

The new `from_gcs` operator reads files from Google Cloud Storage with support
for glob patterns, authentication via Application Default Credentials, and all
standard file processing features like monitoring and path tracking.

### Changes

#### Better kafka diagnostics

The `kafka` related operators now emit more diagnostics in unexpected
situations, providing more information to diagnose problems.

#### Better defaults for `load_kafka`

The `load_kafka` operators previously used `offset="end"` as the default, which
meant that it always started from the end of the topic. This default was now
changed to `"stored"`, such that the previously commited offset is used instead.

### Bug Fixes

#### Pipeline execution under high loads

Previously, the execution of certain pipelines under high load scenarios could
lead to general unresponsiveness. In extreme cases, this meant that the platform
wasn't able to reach the node. This issue has now been resolved, leading to a
more reliable and responsive experience.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#5486](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5486).

#### API request isolation

Requests to the `/pipeline` API are now properly isolated and sequentialized.
Before, it could happen that certain requests that should not be executed
concurrently were interleaved. This could lead to unpredictable results when
interacting with pipelines through the platform.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#5486](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5486).

#### `session_name` and `external_id` in `aws_iam` options

The `load_kafka`, `save_kafka` and `to_kafka` operators now accept configuring
`session_name` and `external_id` for `aws_iam` options.

By [@raxyte](https://github.com/raxyte) in [#5481](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5481).

#### Behavior of the `throttle` operator

The `throttle` operator now correctly forwards its data in a timely manner.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#5488](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5488).

#### Hang in `every` and `cron`

We fixed a bug in `every` and `cron` operators that could cause them to hang
and panic with assertions failures.
