### Features

#### Add an operator for partition candidate checks

The `partitions [<expr>]` source operator supersedes `show partitions` (now
deprecated) and supports an optional expression as a positional argument for
showing only the partitions that would be considered in `export | where <expr>`.

### Bug Fixes

#### Fix deletion of removed configured contexts

We fixed a bug in Tenzir v4.17.2 that sometimes caused the deletion of on-disk
state of configured contexts on startup.
