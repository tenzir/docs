## Features

### Parquet store plugin

A new parquet store plugin allows VAST to store its data as parquet files,
increasing storage efficiency at the expense of higher deserialization costs.
Storage requirements for the VAST database is reduced by another
15-20% compared to the existing segment store with Zstd compression enabled.
CPU usage for suricata import is up ~ 10%,  mostly related to the more
expensive serialization.
Deserialization (reading) of a partition is significantly more expensive,
increasing CPU utilization by about 100%, and should be carefully considered
and compared to the potential reduction in storage cost and I/O operations.

By [@dispanser](https://github.com/dispanser) in [#2284](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2284).

### Report by schema metrics from the importer

VAST now produces additional metrics under the keys `ingest.events`,
`ingest.duration` and `ingest.rate`. Each of those gets issued once for every
schema that VAST ingested during the measurement period. Use the
`metadata_schema` key to disambiguate the metrics.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#2274](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2274).

### Compress in-memory slices with Zstd

VAST now compresses data with Zstd. When persisting data to the segment store,
the default configuration achieves over 2x space savings. When transferring data
between client and server processes, compression reduces the amount of
transferred data by up to 5x. This allowed us to increase the default partition
size from 1,048,576 to 4,194,304 events, and the default number of events in a
single batch from 1,024 to 65,536. The performance increase comes at the cost of
a ~20% memory footprint increase at peak load. Use the option
`vast.max-partition-size` to tune this space-time tradeoff.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2268](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2268).

### Add percentage of total number of events to index status

The index statistics in `vast status --detailed` now show the event distribution
per schema as a percentage of the total number of events in addition to the
per-schema number, e.g., for `suricata.flow` events under the key
`index.statistics.layouts.suricata.flow.percentage`.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2351](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2351).

### PRs 2360-2363

The output `vast status --detailed` now shows metadata from all partitions under
the key `.catalog.partitions`. Additionally, the catalog emits metrics under the
key `catalog.num-events` and `catalog.num-partitions` containing the number of
events and partitions respectively. The metrics contain the schema name in the
field `metadata_schema` and the (internal) partition version in the field
`metadata_partition-version`.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2360](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2360).

### Base image with Closed Source plugins

The VAST Cloud CLI can now authenticate to the Tenzir private registry and
download the vast-pro image (including plugins such as Matcher). The deployment
script can now be configured to use a specific image and can thus be set to use
vast-pro.

By [@rdettai](https://github.com/rdettai) in [#2415](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2415).

### Add new debugging features to VAST tools

The `lsvast` tool can now print contents of individual `.mdx` files.
It now has an option to print raw Bloom filter contents of string
and IP address synopses.

The `mdx-regenerate` tool was renamed to `vast-regenerate` and can
now also regenerate an index file from a list of partition UUIDs.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#2260](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2260).

### PRs 2334-KaanSK

PyVAST now supports running client commands for VAST servers running in a
container environment, if no local VAST binary is available. Specify the
`container` keyword to customize this behavior. It defaults to `{"runtime":
"docker", "name": "vast"}`.

By [@KaanSK](https://github.com/KaanSK) in [#2334](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2334).

### Add index metric for created active partitions

VAST emits the new metric `partition.events-written` when writing a partition to
disk. The metric's value is the number of events written, and the
`metadata_schema` field contains the name of the partition's schema.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#2302](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2302).

### Improve usability of CSV format

The `csv` import gained a new `--seperator='x'` option that defaults to `','`. Set
it to `'\t'` to import tab-separated values, or `' '` to import space-separated
values.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2336](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2336).

### Add a `rebuild` command plugin

The new `rebuild` command rebuilds old partitions to take advantage
of improvements in newer VAST versions. Rebuilding takes place in the VAST
server in the background. This process merges partitions up to the configured
`max-partition-size`, turns VAST v1.x's heterogeneous into VAST v2.x's
homogenous partitions, migrates all data to the currently configured
`store-backend`, and upgrades to the most recent internal batch encoding and
indexes.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2321](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2321).

### Compress serialized indexers

VAST now compresses on-disk indexes with Zstd, resulting in a 50-80% size
reduction depending on the type of indexes used, and reducing the overall index
size to below the raw data size. This improves retention spans significantly.
For example, using the default configuration, the indexes for `suricata.ftp`
events now use 75% less disk space, and `suricata.flow` 30% less.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2346](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2346).

### Add optional status command filters

The `status` command now supports filtering by component name. E.g.,
`vast status importer index` only shows the status of the importer and
index components.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2288](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2288).

## Changes

### Parquet store plugin

VAST now requires Arrow >= v8.0.0.

By [@dispanser](https://github.com/dispanser) in [#2284](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2284).

### Always format time values with microsecond precision

VAST will from now on always format `time` and `timestamp` values with six
decimal places (microsecond precision). The old behavior used a precision that
depended on the actual value. This may require action for downstream tooling
like metrics collectors that expect nanosecond granularity.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#2380](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2380).

### Remove legacy index from VAST

The `vast.use-legacy-query-scheduler` option is now ignored because the legacy
query scheduler has been removed.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#2312](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2312).

### Deprecate the archive store-backend

The `vast.store-backend` configuration option no longer supports `archive`,
and instead always uses the superior `segment-store` instead. Events stored in
the archive will continue to be available in queries.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2290](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2290).

### Write homogenous partitions from the partition transformer

Partition transforms now always emit homogenous partitions, i.e., one schema per
partition. This makes compaction and aging more efficient.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#2277](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2277).

### Add new debugging features to VAST tools

The `mdx-regenerate` tool is no longer part of VAST binary releases.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#2260](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2260).

## Bug Fixes

### Improve index crash recovery

We improved the mechanism to recover the database state after an unclean
shutdown.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#2394](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2394).

### Use fast_float to parse reals

The parser for `real` values now understands scientific notation, e.g.,
`1.23e+42`.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#2332](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2332).

### Prefer CLI over config file for vast.plugins

The command-line options `--plugins`, `--plugin-dirs`, and `--schema-dirs` now
correctly overwrite their corresponding configuration options.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2289](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2289).

### Fix crash in query evaluation for new partitions

VAST no longer crashes when a query arrives at a newly created active partition
in the time window between the partition creation and the first event arriving
at the partition.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2295](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2295).

### Respect the default fp-rate setting

VAST now reads the default false-positive rate for sketches correctly. This
broke accidentally with the v2.0 release. The option moved from
`vast.catalog-fp-rate` to `vast.index.default-fp-rate`.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2325](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2325).

### Parse time from JSON strings containing numbers

The JSON import now treats `time` and `duration` fields correctly for JSON
strings containing a number, i.e., the JSON string `"1654735756"` now behaves
just like the JSON number `1654735756` and for a `time` field results in the
value `2022-06-09T00:49:16.000Z`.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2340](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2340).

### The index shall not quit on write errors

VAST will no longer terminate when it can't write any more data to disk.
Incoming data will still be accepted but discarded. We encourage all users to
enable the disk-monitor or compaction features as a proper solution to this
problem.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#2376](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2376).

### Fall back to string when parsing config options from environment

Setting the environment variable `VAST_ENDPOINT` to `host:port` pair no longer
fails on startup with a parse error.

By [@dispanser](https://github.com/dispanser) in [#2305](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2305).

### Improve usability of CSV format

The `csv` import no longer crashes when the CSV file contains columns not
present in the selected schema. Instead, it imports these columns as strings.

`vast export csv` now renders enum columns in their string representation
instead of their internal numerical representation.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2336](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2336).

### Allow missing value indices in partition flatbuffer

VAST no longer crashes when importing `map` or `pattern` data annotated with the
`#skip` attribute.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#2286](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2286).

### Fix occasional shutdown hangs

VAST no longer hangs when it is shut down while still importing events.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#2324](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2324).

### Support environment variables for plugin options

VAST no longer ignores environment variables for plugin-specific options. E.g.,
the environment variable `VAST_PLUGINS__FOO__BAR` now correctly refers to the
`bar` option of the `foo` plugin, i.e., `plugins.foo.bar`.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2390](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2390).
