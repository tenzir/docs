### Bug Fixes

#### PRs 4295-4322-4325

We fixed a bug that very rarely caused configured pipelines using contexts to
fail starting up because the used context was not available, and similarly to
fail shutting down because the used context was no longer available before the
pipeline was shut down.

#### Fix minor issues with the diagnostics and metrics collector

We fixed an issue where diagnostics were not properly propagated and thus not
available to the `diagnostics` operator.
