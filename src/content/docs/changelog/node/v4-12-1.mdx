## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Consolidate community and enterprise edition builds

We fixed a misconfiguration that caused the `publish` and `subscribe` operators
not to be available in the statically linked Linux builds.

We fixed a crash on startup when selectively enabling or disabling plugins when
at least two plugins with dependent plugins were disabled.
