### Features

#### Load plugin schemas after built-in schemas

Plugin schemas are now installed to `<datadir>/vast/plugin/<plugin>/schema`,
while VAST's built-in schemas reside in `<datadir>/vast/schema`. The load order
guarantees that plugins are able to reliably override the schemas bundled with
VAST.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1608](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1608).

#### Support optional numeric duration output for JSON

To enable easier post-processing, the new option
`vast.export.json.numeric-durations` switches JSON output of `duration` types
from human-readable strings (e.g., `"4.2m"`) to numeric (e.g., `252.15`) in
fractional seconds.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1628](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1628).

#### Add a timeout option to the export command

The new option `vast export --timeout=<duration>` allows for setting a timeout
for VAST queries. Cancelled exports result in a non-zero exit code.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1611](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1611).

#### PRs 1517-1656

The new *transforms* feature allows VAST to apply transformations to incoming
and outgoing data. A transform consists of a sequence of steps that execute
sequentially, e.g., to remove, overwrite, hash, encrypt data. A new plugin type
makes it easy to write custom transforms.

#### Add step size to disk monitor

The new setting `vast.disk-monitor-step-size` enables the disk monitor
to remove *N* partitions at once before re-checking if the new size of the
database directory is now small enough. This is useful when checking the size
of a directory is an expensive operation itself, e.g., on compressed
filesystems.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#1655](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1655).

#### Print the remote-version in the status command

The `status` command now prints the VAST server version information under the
`version` key.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1652](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1652).

### Changes

#### Don't send dynamic type information to connecting sources

Schemas are no longer implicitly shared between sources, i.e., an `import`
process importing data with a custom schema will no longer affect other
sources started at a later point in time. Schemas known to the VAST server
process are still available to all `import` processes. We do not expect this
change to have a real-world impact, but it could break setups where some
sources have been installed on hosts without their own schema files, the
VAST server did not have up-to-date schema files, and other sources were
(ab)used to provide the latest type information.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#1656](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1656).

#### Deprecate builds without Apache Arrow

Building VAST without Apache Arrow via `-DVAST_ENABLE_ARROW=OFF` is now
deprecated, and support for the option will be removed in a future release. As
the Arrow ecosystem and libraries matured, we feel confident in making it a
required dependency and plan to build upon it more in the future.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1682](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1682).

#### Remove configure script

The `configure` script was removed. This was a custom script that
mimicked the functionality of an autotools-based `configure` script
by writing directly to the cmake cache. Instead, users now must use
the `cmake` and/or `ccmake` binaries directly to configure VAST.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#1657](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1657).

### Bug Fixes

#### Sort loaded plugins by name

VAST no longer erroneously warns about a version mismatch between client and
server when their plugin load order differs.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1679](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1679).

#### Print the remote-version in the status command

VAST no longer erroneously skips the version mismatch detection between client
and server. The check now additionally compares running plugins.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1652](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1652).

#### Error when initializing a plugin fails

VAST now correctly refuses to run when loaded plugins fail their initialization,
i.e., are in a state that cannot be reasoned about.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1618](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1618).

#### Allow for running unit tests in parallel

Executing VAST's unit test suite in parallel no longer fails.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1659](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1659).

#### Fix install dirs wrt binary relocatability

Non-relocatable VAST binaries no longer look for configuration, schemas, and
plugins in directories relative to the binary location. Vice versa, relocatable
VAST binaries no longer look for configuration, schemas, and plugins in their
original install directory, and instead always use paths relative to their
binary location. On macOS, we now always build relocatable binaries.
Relocatable binaries now work correctly on systems where the libary install
directory is `lib64` instead of `lib`.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1624](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1624).

#### Fix the datagram source

A recent change caused imports over UDP not to forward its events to the VAST
server process. Running `vast import -l :<port>/udp <format>` now works as
expected again.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1622](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1622).

#### Fix build without Arrow

VAST and transform plugins now build without Arrow support again.

The `delete` transform step correctly deletes fields from the layout when
running VAST with Arrow disabled.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1673](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1673).
