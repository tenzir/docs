### Features

#### Restore unique IDs for partition-local stores

The `segment-store` store backend works correctly with `vast get` and
`vast explore`.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#1805](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1805).

#### PRs 1819-1833

VAST can now process Eve JSON events of type `suricata.packet` that Suricata
emits when the config option `tagged-packets` is set and a rule tags a packet
using, e.g., `tag:session,5,packets;`.

By [@satta](https://github.com/satta) in [#1819](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1819).

### Changes

#### Support building against fmt 8.x

VAST now supports building against fmt 8 and spdlog 1.9.2, and now requires
at least fmt 7.1.3.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1846](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1846).

#### Keep layer-2 framing when reading PCAP payload

VAST no longer strips link-layer framing when ingesting PCAPs. The stored
payload is the raw PCAP packet. Similarly, `vast export pcap` now includes a
Ethernet link-layer framing, per libpcap's `DLT_EN10MB` link type.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#1797](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1797).

#### Improve rendering of error messages & fix record to map conversion

Strings in error or warning log messages are no longer escaped, greatly
improving readability of messages containing nested error contexts.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#1842](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1842).

#### Align suricata.dhcp with the latest eve.log schema

VAST now ships with an updated schema type for the `suricata.dhcp` event,
covering all fields of the extended output.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#1854](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1854).

### Bug Fixes

#### Fix logging in systemd when built without support

VAST now only switches to journald style logging by default when it is actually
supported.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#1857](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1857).

#### Include in-process sources/sinks in status output

The output of VAST status now includes status information for sources and sinks
spawned in the VAST node, i.e., via `vast spawn source|sink <format>` rather
than `vast import|export <format>`.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1852](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1852).

#### Print memory counts in bytes instead of kB

The memory counts in the output of `vast status` now represent bytes
consistently, as opposed to a mix of bytes and kilobytes.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#1862](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1862).

#### Fix plugin versions in prebuilt Docker images

Plugins in the prebuilt Docker images no longer show `unspecified` as their
version.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1828](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1828).

#### Use /etc as sysconfdir for install prefix /usr

In order to align with the [GNU Coding
Standards](https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Directory-Variables.html),
the static binary (and other relocatable binaries) now uses `/etc` as
sysconfdir for installations to `/usr/bin/vast`.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1856](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1856).

#### Add missing concepts for Suricata events

Previously missing fields of suricata event types are now part of the concept
definitions of `net.src.ip`, `net.src.port`, `net.dst.ip`, `net.dst.port`,
`net.app`, `net.proto`, `net.community_id`, `net.vlan`, and `net.packets`.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#1798](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1798).

#### Support quoted non-string fields in the CSV parser

The CSV parser now correctly parses quoted fields in non-string types. E.g.,
`"127.0.0.1"` in CSV now successfully parsers when a matching schema contains
an `address` type field.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1858](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1858).

#### Gracefully handle malformed segments at startup

Invalid segment files will no longer crash VAST at startup.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#1820](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1820).

#### Support native plugins in the static binary

The `segment-store` store backend and built-in transform steps (`hash`,
`replace`, and `delete`) now function correctly in static VAST binaries.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1850](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1850).

#### Interpret metrics paths relative to the db root

The configuration options `vast.metrics.{file,uds}-sink.path` now correctly
specify paths relative to the database directory of VAST, rather than the
current working directory of the VAST server.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1848](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1848).
