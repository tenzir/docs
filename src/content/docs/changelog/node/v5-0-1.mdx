### Features

#### Fix bugs in `to_clickhouse` and improve diagnostics

The `to_clickhouse` operator now supports `blob`s, which will be sent as an
`Array(UInt8)`.

### Bug Fixes

#### Fix bugs in `to_clickhouse` and improve diagnostics

We fixed multiple bugs that caused unexpected internal failures and the creation
of potentially empty `Tuple`s in ClickHouse.

#### Keep the y-axis order for `chart_*` as specified

The `chart_*` operators no longer sort y-axes by their names. Instead, the
user-provided order is used. For example, in `metrics "pipeline" | chart_bar
x=timestamp, resolution=1d, y={"Ingress": ingress.bytes.sum(), "Egress":
egress.bytes.sum()}` the field order is now "Ingress" followed by "Egress"
as specified instead of the other way around.
