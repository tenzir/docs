## Features

### Make debugging `load_tcp` pipelines easier

The newly added `max_buffered_chunks` for `load_tcp` controls how many reads
the operator schedules in advance on the socket. The option defaults to 10.

## Changes

### Improve panics to show stacktrace in diagnostics and logs

We have improved how internal errors are presented to the user, making it easier
to report and analyze bugs.

## Bug Fixes

### Ignore additional fields in package config

Installing packages no longer fails when packages contain additional fields, and
instead warns about the unexpected fields.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#5031](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5031).

### Fix splitting logic for heterogeneous evaluation

Expressions that have varying output types for the same input types (mostly the
`parse_*` family of functions) no longer trigger an assertion on certain inputs.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#5043](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5043).

### Fix hang in `cache` when creating an empty cache

The `cache` operator no longer hangs indefinitely when creating a new cache from
a pipeline that returned zero events. For example, the pipeline `from {} | head
0 | cache "whoops"` never exited before this fix.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#5042](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5042).

### Avoid idle wakeups in `load_tcp`

We fixed a bug that caused unnecessary idle wakeups in the `load_tcp` operator,
throwing off scheduling of pipelines using it. Under rare circumstances, this
could also lead to partially duplicated output of the operator's nested
pipeline.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#5035](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5035).

### Fix cache eviction always happening on maximally large caches

We fixed a bug in the `cache` operator that caused caches that were capped just
short of the `tenzir.cache.capacity` option to still get evicted immediately.

By [@Avaq](https://github.com/Avaq) in [#5039](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5039).

### Fix mismatch in type metadata after assignments

We fixed a bug that caused a loss of type names for nested fields in
assignments, causing field metadata in `write_feather` and `write_parquet` to be
missing.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#5033](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5033).

### Change how signed ints are rendered in logs

We fixed a bug in the `from_fluent_bit` and `to_fluent_bit` operators that
caused positive integer options to be forwarded with a leading `+`. For example,
`options={port: 9200}` forwarded the option `port=+9200` to Fluent Bit.
