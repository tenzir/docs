This release adds support for escape sequences in string literals.

Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/releases/tag/v5.1.5).

### Features

#### Support escape sequences in string literals

String literals in TQL now support Unicode escape sequences like `\xHH`,
`\uHHHH`, `\UHHHHHHHH`, and `\u{...}`. Additionally, the named escape sequences
`\r`, `\b`, `\f`, `\v`, `\a`, and `\e`, are now supported in addition to the
previously supported `\n`, `\t`, and `\0`.

TQL now supports literals for blobs through the `b"..."` syntax (or
alternatively `br#"..."#`). Blobs are a sequence of bytes that unlike strings
do not need to hold valid UTF-8, and can as such represent any binary data.
