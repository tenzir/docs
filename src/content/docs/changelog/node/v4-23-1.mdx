### Bug Fixes

#### Only wipe the cache directory contents but not the dir itself

The node doesn't try to recreate its cache directory on startup anymore,
avoiding permissions issues on systems with strict access control.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#4742](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4742).

#### Use separate volumes in docker-compose

The `docker compose` setup now uses separate local volumes for each `tenzir` directory. This fixes a bug where restarting the container resets installed packages or pipelines.

By [@sunnewehr](https://github.com/sunnewehr) in [#4749](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4749).

#### Normalize expressions for live and unpersisted data

We fixed a crash in pipelines that use the `export` operator and a subsequent
`where` filter with certain expressions.

#### Build the `parquet` plugin in the Dockerfile

The `parquet` plugin is now available in the `tenzir/tenzir` and
`tenzir/tenzir-node` Docker images.

#### Fix configuration options for the kafka plugin

We fixed a bug in the kafka plugin so that it no longer wrongly splits config
options from the `yaml` files at the dot character.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#4761](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4761).

#### Fix syslog parser not yielding on infinite streams

We fixed a bug causing the `syslog` parser to never yield events until the input
stream ended.

By [@IyeOnline](https://github.com/IyeOnline) in [#4777](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4777).

#### Fix bugs in `where` when predicate evaluates to `null`

We fixed a bug in TQL2's `where` operator that made it sometimes return
incorrect results for events for which the predicate evaluated to `null`. Now,
the operator consistently warns when this happens and drops the events.
