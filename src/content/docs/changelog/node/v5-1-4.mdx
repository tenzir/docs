This PR restores the ability to customize the `import` operator's compression
level.

Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/releases/tag/v5.1.4).

### Bug Fixes

#### Do not ignore the `tenzir.zstd-compression-level` option

The `tenzir.zstd-compression-level` option now works again as advertised for
setting the Zstd compression level for the partitions written by the `import`
operator. For the past few releases, newly written partitions unconditionally
used the default compression level.

#### Fix lifetime issues and small bugs in `write_syslog`

We fixed a crash in `write_syslog` when receiving unexpected inputs and improved
some diagnostics.
