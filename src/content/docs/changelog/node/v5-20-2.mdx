### Bug Fixes

#### Fixed assertion failure in `to_hive`

We addressed an assertion failure in the `to_hive` operator, which could fail
the partitioned writes for some data and format combinations.

#### Improved parquet support

We fixed a crash when performing some operations on data read from external
parquet files, such as Amazon Security Lake.

#### Fixed `write_parquet`

In the last release we introduced a bug that made the `write_parquet` operator
exit early without writing the file. This has now been fixed.
