### Features

#### Add `show serves` for debugging the `serve` operator

`show serves` displays all currently active serve IDs in the `/serve` API
endpoint, showing an overview of active pipelines with an on-demand API.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3596](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3596).

#### Implement a RabbitMQ-based AMQP connector

The new `amqp` connector enables interaction with an AMQP 0-9-1 exchange,
supporting working with messages as producer (saver) and consumer (loader).

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#3546](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3546).

#### Implement extended deployment options

The new `ttl_expires_in_ns` shows the remaining time to live for a pipeline in
the pipeline manager.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#3585](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3585).

#### Add a `yara` operator

The new `yara` operator matches Yara rules on byte streams, producing structured
events when rules match.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#3594](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3594).

#### Add `blob` type for arbitrary binary data

The new `blob` type can be used to represent arbitrary binary data.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#3581](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3581).

#### Add a --live option to the export operator

The `export` operator now has a `--live` option to continuously emit events as
they are imported instead of those that already reside in the database.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#3612](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3612).

#### Add a `velociraptor` operator

The new `velociraptor` source supports submitting VQL queries to a Velociraptor
server. The operator communicates with the server via gRPC using a mutually
authenticated and encrypted connection with client certificates. For example,
`velociraptor -q "select * from pslist()"` lists processes and their running
binaries.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#3556](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3556).

#### Update the plugins submodule pointer to include extended & serialized pipeline states

The new `completed` pipeline state in the pipeline manager shows when a
pipeline has finished execution.

If the node with running pipelines crashes, they will be marked as `failed`
upon restarting.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#3554](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3554).

#### Add `events` field to output of `show partitions`

The output of `show partitions` includes a new `events` field that shows the
number of events kept in that partition. E.g., the pipeline `show partitions |
summarize events=sum(events) by schema` shows the number of events per schema
stored at the node.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3580](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3580).

### Changes

#### Implement extended deployment options

The new `autostart` and `autodelete` parameters for the pipeline manager
supersede the `start_when_created` and `restart_with_node` parameters and
extend restarting and deletion possibilities for pipelines.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#3585](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3585).

#### Add `blob` type for arbitrary binary data

The `string` type is now restricted to valid UTF-8 strings. Use `blob` for
arbitrary binary data.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#3581](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3581).

### Bug Fixes

#### Detect and report incomplete object in JSON parser

When using `read json`, incomplete objects (e.g., due to truncated files) are
now reported as an error instead of silently discarded.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#3570](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3570).

#### Fix `serve` exiting prematurely

Pipelines ending with the `serve` operator no longer incorrectly exit 60 seconds
after transferring all events to the `/serve` endpoint, but rather wait until
all events were fetched from the endpoint.

Shutting down a node immediately after starting it now no longer waits for all
partitions to be loaded.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3562](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3562).

#### Fix parsing of subnet columns in zeek-tsv

The `zeek-tsv` parser is now able to handle fields of type `subnet` correctly.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#3606](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3606).

#### Check for duplicate field names in zeek_tsv_parser

Having duplicate field names in `zeek-tsv` data no longer causes a crash,
but rather errors out gracefully.

By [@eliaskosunen](https://github.com/eliaskosunen) in [#3578](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3578).

#### Fix predicate pushdown in `export` and other small fixes

A regression in Tenzir v4.3 caused exports to often consider all partitions as
candidates. Pipelines of the form `export | where <expr>` now work as expected
again and only load relevant partitions from disk.

The long option `--skip-empty` for `read lines` now works as documented.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3599](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3599).

#### Upgrade remaining usages of the adaptive table slice builder

The `csv` parsed (or more generally, the `xsv` parser) now attempts to parse
fields in order to infer their types.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#3582](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3582).
