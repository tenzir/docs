### Features

#### Add the `buffer` operator for breaking back pressure

The `buffer` operator buffers up to the specified number of events in an
in-memory buffer. By default, operators in a pipeline run only when their
downstream operators want to receive input. This mechanism is called back
pressure. The `buffer` operator effectively breaks back pressure by storing up
to the specified number of events in memory, always requesting more input, which
allows upstream operators to run uninterruptedly even in case the downstream
operators of the buffer are unable to keep up. This allows pipelines to handle
data spikes more easily.

#### Add a package manager

The new `package` operator allows for adding and removing packages, a
combination of pipelines and contexts deployed to a node as a set. Nodes load
packages installed to `<configdir>/tenzir/package/<package-name>/package.yaml`
on startup.

### Changes

#### Remove the `use_simple_format` option for `/serve`

The `/serve` endpoint now always uses the simple output format for schema
definitions. The option `use_simple_format` is now ignored.

#### Refactor python operator setup

The `python` operator now resolves dependencies with every fresh pipeline run.
Just restart your pipeline to upgrade to the latest available versions of your
Python modules.

The `python` operator no longer uses `pip` but rather
[`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv). In case you set custom environment
variables for `pip` you need to exchange those with alternative settings that
work with `uv`.

### Bug Fixes

#### Add the `buffer` operator for breaking back pressure

Metrics emitted towards the end of an operator's runtime were sometimes not
recorded correctly. This now works reliably.
