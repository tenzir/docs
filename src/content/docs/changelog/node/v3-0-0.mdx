### Features

#### Add `vast import arrow` enabling ingestion of arrow IPC format

VAST now imports Arrow IPC data, which is the same format it already
supports for export.

By [@dispanser](https://github.com/dispanser) in [#2707](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2707).

#### Add CORS preflight request handling

The experimental web frontend now correctly responds to CORS preflight requests.
To configure CORS behavior, the new `vast.web.cors-allowed-origin` config option
can be used.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#2944](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2944).

#### Support pattern case insensitivity in Sigma plugin

The `sigma` plugin now treats Sigma strings as case-insensitive patterns during
the transpilation process.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#2974](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2974).

#### Make it easy to create docker images with Nix

We now offer a `tenzir/vast-slim` image as an alternative to the `tenzir/vast`
image. The image is minimal in size and supports the same features as the
regular image, but does not support building additional plugins against it and
mounting in additional plugins.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#2742](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2742).

#### Add 'pseudonymize' pipeline operator

The new `pseudonymize` pipeline operator pseudonymizes IP addresses in
user-specified fields.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#2719](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2719).

#### Implement support for `:string == /pattern/` queries

Queries of the forms `:string == /pattern/`, `field == /pattern/`, `#type ==
/pattern/`, and their respective negations now work as expected.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2769](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2769).

#### Add options to omit empty values when exporting as JSON

The JSON export format gained the options `--omit-empty-records`,
`--omit-empty-lists`, and `--omit-empty-maps`, which cause empty records, lists,
and maps not to be rendered respectively. The options may be combined together
with the existing `--omit-nulls` option. Use `--omit-empty` to set all four
flags at once.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2856](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2856).

#### Add 'pipeline' parameter and schematized format to export endpoint

The `/export` family of endpoints now accepts an optional `pipeline`
parameter to specify an ad-hoc pipeline that should be applied to
the exported data.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#2773](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2773).

#### Support case insensitivity in patterns

Patterns now support case insensitivity by adding `i` to the pattern string,
e.g. `/^\w{3}$/i`.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#2951](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2951).

#### Add a new /openapi.json endpoint to the web plugin

The experimental web plugin now serves its own API specification
at the new '/openapi.json' endpoint.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#2981](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2981).

#### Eliminate shutdown lag from the signal monitor

The new `/query` endpoint for the experimental REST API allows users to receive
query data in multiple steps, as opposed to a oneshot export.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#2766](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2766).

#### Implement `head` and `taste` operators

The new `head` and `taste` operators limit results to the specified number of
events. The `head` operator applies this limit for all events, and the `taste`
operator applies it per schema. Both operators take the limit as an optional
argument, with the default value being 10.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2891](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2891).

#### PRs 2877-2904-2907

The `export` and `import` commands now support an optional pipeline string
that allows for chaining pipeline operators together and executing such a
pipeline on outgoing and incoming data. This feature is experimental and the
syntax is subject to change without notice. New operators are only available in
the new pipeline syntax, and the old YAML syntax is deprecated.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#2877](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2877).

#### Add extractor predicates

Extractors such as `x` and `:T` can now expand to the predicates `x != null`
and `:T != null`, respectively.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#2984](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2984).

#### Implement a retry mechanism for VAST clients failing to connect to the server

We changed VAST client processes to attempt connecting to a VAST server multiple
times until the configured connection timeout (`vast.connection-timeout`,
defaults to 5 minutes) runs out. A fixed delay between connection attempts
(`vast.connection-retry-delay`, defaults to 3 seconds) ensures that clients to
not stress the server too much. Set the connection timeout to zero to let VAST
client attempt connecting indefinitely, and the delay to zero to disable the
retry mechanism.

By [@patszt](https://github.com/patszt) in [#2835](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2835).

#### Install Python bindings along with VAST

VAST installations and packages now include Python bindings in a site-package
under `<install-prefix>/lib/python*/site-packages/vast`.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2636](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2636).

#### Add CEF reader plugin

The `cef` import format allows for reading events in the Common Event Format
(CEF) via `vast import cef < cef.log`.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#2216](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2216).

### Changes

#### Add 'pseudonymize' pipeline operator

OpenSSL is now a required dependency.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#2719](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2719).

#### Remove broker plugin

We removed the broker plugin that enabled direct Zeek 3.x log transfer to VAST.
The plugin will return in the future rewritten for Zeek 5+.

By [@patszt](https://github.com/patszt) in [#2796](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2796).

#### PRs 2769-2873

The match operator `~`, its negation `!~`, and the `pattern` type no longer
exist. Use queries of the forms `lhs == /rhs/` and `lhs != /rhs/` instead for
queries using regular expressions.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2769](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2769).

#### Replace 'nil' with 'null'

The non-value literal in expressions has a new syntax: `null` replaces its old
representation `nil`. For example, the query `x != nil` is no longer valid; use
`x != null` instead.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#2999](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2999).

#### Deprecate `vast.pipeline-triggers`

The `vast.pipeline-triggers` option is deprecated; while it continues to
work as-is, support for it will be removed in the next release. Use the
new inline import and export pipelines instead. They will return as more
generally applicable node ingress and egress pipelines in the future.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3008](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3008).

#### Remove the `#field` meta extractor

The `#field` meta extractor no longer exists. Use `X != null` over `#field ==
"X"` to check for existence for the field `X`.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2776](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2776).

#### Rename count, int, real, and addr to uint64, int64, double, and ip respectively

The builtin types `count`, `int`, `real`, and `addr` were renamed to `uint64`,
`int64`, `double`, and `ip` respectively. For backwards-compatibility, VAST
still supports parsing the old type tokens in schema files.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2864](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2864).

#### Use CAF streaming in export command

The `explore` and `pivot` commands are now unavailable. They will be
reintroduced as pipeline operators in the future.

By [@patszt](https://github.com/patszt) in [#2898](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2898).

#### Introduce a potpourri of smaller improvements

Plugin names are now case-insensitive.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2832](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2832).

#### Introduce a potpourri of smaller improvements

VAST now ignores the previously deprecated options `vast.meta-index-fp-rate`,
`vast.catalog-fp-rate`, `vast.transforms` and `vast.transform-triggers`.
Similarly, setting `vast.store-backend` to `segment-store` now results in an
error rather than a graceful fallback to the default store.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2832](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2832).

#### Provide an Ansible role for VAST

VAST now comes with a role definition for Ansible. You can find it directly in
the `ansible` subdirectory.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#2604](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2604).

#### Rename `identity` operator to `pass`

We renamed the `identity` operator to `pass`.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#2980](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2980).

#### PRs 2922-2927

We removed the frontend prototype bundled with the web plugin Some parts of the
frontend that we have in development are designed to be closed-source, and it is
easier to develop at the current development stage in a single repository that
is not bound to the release process of VAST itself. An open-source version of
the frontend may return in the future.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2922](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2922).

#### Update response format of the /export endpoint

For the experimental REST API, the result format of the `/export` endpoint
was modified: The `num_events` key was renamed to `num-events`, and the
`version` key was removed.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#2899](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2899).

#### Change boolean literals to `true` and `false`

Boolean literals in expressions have a new syntax: `true` and `false` replace
the old representations `T` and `F`. For example, the query
`suricata.alert.alerted == T` is no longer valid; use `suricata.alert.alerted ==
true` instead.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2844](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2844).

#### Make the map type inaccessible to users

The `map` type no longer exists: instead of `map<T, U>`, use the equivalent
`list<record{ key: T, value: U }>`.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2976](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2976).

#### Switch default TCP port to 5158

From now on VAST will use TCP port 5158 for its native inter process
communication. This change avoids collisions from dynamic port allocation on
Linux systems.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#2998](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2998).

#### PRs 2807-2848

Blocking imports now imply that ingested data gets persisted to disk before the
the `vast import` process exits.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#2807](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2807).

#### Remove the /export endpoint

The REST API does not contain the `/export` and `/export/with-schemas`
endpoints anymore. Any previous queries using those endpoints have to be sent
to the `/query` endpoint now.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#2990](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2990).

#### Merge the type-registry into the catalog

`vast status` no longer shows type registry-related information. Instead, refer
to `vast show` for detailed type metadata information.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#2745](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2745).

#### PRs 2693-2923

Building VAST now requires CAF 0.18.7. VAST supports setting advanced options
for CAF directly in its configuration file under the `caf` section. If you were
using any of these, compare them against the bundled `vast.yaml.example` file to
see if you need to make any changes. The change has (mostly positive)
[performance and stability
implications](https://www.actor-framework.org/blog/2021-01/benchmarking-0.18/)
throughout VAST, especially in high-load scenarios.

By [@patszt](https://github.com/patszt) in [#2693](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2693).

#### Align output of the Zeek TSV reader with schemas

The bundled Zeek schema no longer includes the `_path` field included in Zeek
JSON. Use `#type == "zeek.foo"` over `_path == "foo"` for querying data ingested
using `vast import zeek-json`.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2887](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2887).

#### PRs 2778-2797-2798

VAST no longer supports reading partitions created with VAST versions older than
VAST v2.2. Since VAST v2.2, VAST continuously upgrades old partitions to the
most recent internal format while running.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2778](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2778).

#### Move event distribution statistics to the catalog

The per-schema event distribution moved from `index.statistics.layouts` to
`catalog.schemas`, and additionally includes information about the import time
range and the number of partitions VAST knows for the schema. The number of
events per schema no longer includes events that are yet unpersisted.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2852](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2852).

#### Move taxonomy resolution to the catalog

`vast status` does not work anymore with an embedded node (i.e., spawned with
the `-N` parameter).

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#2771](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2771).

### Bug Fixes

#### Fix rounding issue when printing duration types

We fixed incorrect printing of human-readable durations in some edge cases.
E.g., the value 1.999s was rendered as 1.1s instead of the expected 2.0s. This
bug affected the JSON and CSV export formats, and all durations printed in log
messages or the status command.

By [@patszt](https://github.com/patszt) in [#2906](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2906).

#### Fix linux PID file check on startup

VAST no longer ignores existing PID lock files on Linux.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#2861](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2861).

#### Add a workaround to fix CAF OpenSSL options

Options passed in the `caf.openssl` section in the configuration file or as
`VAST_CAF__OPENSSL__*` environment variables are no longer ignored.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#2908](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2908).

#### Align output of the Zeek TSV reader with schemas

The Zeek TSV reader now respects the schema files in the bundled `zeek.schema`
file, and produces data of the same schema as the Zeek JSON reader. E.g.,
instead of producing a top-level ip field `id.orig_h`, the reader now produces a
top-level record field `id` that contains the ip field `orig_h`, effectively
unflattening the data.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2887](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2887).

#### Prevent query_processor from hanging when there are no candidate partitions

The VAST client will now terminate properly when using the `count` command with
a query which delivers zero results.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#2924](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2924).

#### Run start commands asynchronously

The start commands specified with the `vast.start.commands` option are now run
aynchronously. This means that commands that block indefinitely will no longer
prevent execution of subsequent commands, and allow for correct signal handling.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#2868](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2868).

#### Bump CAF to version 0.18.6

Attempting to connect with thousands of clients around the same time
sometimes crashed the VAST server. This no longer occurs.

By [@patszt](https://github.com/patszt) in [#2693](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2693).

#### Remove the transformer actor

Pipelines that reduce the number of events do not prevent `vast export`
processes that have a `max-events` limit from terminating any more.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#2896](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2896).

#### Infer non-config types in extend and replace operators

The `replace` and `extend` pipeline operators wrongly inferred IP address,
subnet, pattern, and map values as strings. They are now inferred correctly. To
force a value to be inferred as a string, wrap it inside double quotes.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2768](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2768).

#### Trigger new compaction runs immediately on error

Compaction now retries immediately on failure instead of waiting for the
configured scan interval to expire again.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3006](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3006).

#### Fix some shutdown issues in the web plugin

The web plugin now reacts correctly to CTRL-C by stopping itself.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#2860](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2860).

#### Fix infinite recursion in the record algebra parser

VAST no longer crashes when it encounters an invalid type expression in a
schema.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#2977](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2977).

#### Introduce a potpourri of smaller improvements

VAST now shuts down instantly when metrics are enabled instead of being held
alive for up to the duration of the telemetry interval (10 seconds).

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#2832](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/2832).
