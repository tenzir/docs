### Features

#### Add the enumerate operator

The new `enumerate` operator prepends a column with the row number of the input
records.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#3142](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3142).

#### Add colors to JSON printer

The `json` printer can now colorize its output by providing the
`-C|--color-output` option, and explicitly disable coloring via
`-M|--monochrome-output`.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#3343](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3343).

#### Add `show` operator

The new `show` source operator makes it possible to gather meta information
about Tenzir. For example, the provided introspection capabilities allow for
emitting existing formats, connectors, and operators.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#3414](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3414).

#### Rename `#type` to `#schema` and introduce `#schema_id`

The new `#schema_id` meta extractor returns a unique fingerprint for the schema.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#3183](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3183).

#### Expose the `batch` operator underlying rebuild

The `batch <limit>` operator allows expert users to control batch sizes in
pipelines explicitly.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3391](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3391).

#### Revamp packet acquisition and parsing

The new `nic` plugin provides a loader that acquires packets from a network
interface card using libpcap. It emits chunks of data in the PCAP file format so
that the `pcap` parser can process them as if packets come from a trace file.

The new `decapsulate` operator processes events of type `pcap.packet` and emits
new events of type `tenzir.packet` that contain the decapsulated PCAP packet
with packet header fields from the link, network, and transport layer. The
operator also computes a Community ID.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#3263](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3263).

#### Add --append and --real-time to directory saver

The `directory` saver now supports the two arguments `-a|--append` and
`-r|--realtime` that have the same semantics as they have for the `file` saver:
open files in the directory in append mode (instead of overwriting) and flush
the output buffers on every update.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#3379](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3379).

#### Use `load -` and `read json` as implicit sources

Pipelines executed locally with `tenzir` now use `load -` and `read json` as
implicit sources. This complements `save -` and `write json --pretty` as
implicit sinks.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3329](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3329).

#### Fix sporadic stalling of pipelines

The pipeline manager now accepts empty strings for the optional `name`. The
`/create` endpoint returns a list of diagnostics if pipeline creation fails,
and if `start_when_created` is set, the endpoint now returns only after the
pipeline execution has been fully started. The `/list` endpoint now returns
the diagnostics collected for every pipeline so far. The `/delete` endpoint
now returns an empty object if the request is successful.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3264](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3264).

#### Add a `--schema` option to the JSON parser

The `--schema` option for the JSON parser allows for setting the target schema
explicitly by name.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3295](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3295).

#### Expose pipeline operator metrics in execution node and pipeline executor

Pipeline metrics (total ingress/egress amount and average rate per second) are
now visible in the `pipeline-manager`, via the `metrics` field in the
`/pipeline/list` endpoint result.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#3376](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3376).

#### Implement `top` and `rare`

The `top <field>` operator makes it easy to find the most common values for the
given field. Likewise, `rare <field>` returns the least common values for the
given field.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3176](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3176).

#### Implement the `unflatten` operator

The `unflatten [<separator>]` operator unflattens data structures by creating
nested records out of fields whose names contain a `<separator>`.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#3304](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3304).

#### Implement a `sort` operator

The new `sort` operator allows for arranging events by field, in ascending and
descending order. The current version is still "beta" and has known limitations.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3155](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3155).

#### Add a `--cumulative` option to the `measure` operator

The `measure` operator now returns running totals with the `--cumulative`
option.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3156](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3156).

#### Change `summarize` to operate across schemas

The `summarize` operator now works across multiple schemas and can combine
events of different schemas into one group. It now also treats missing columns
as having `null` values.

The `by` clause of `summarize` is now optional. If it is omitted, all events
are assigned to the same group.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#3250](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3250).

#### Add diagnostics (and some other improvements)

In addition to `tenzir "<pipeline>"`, there now is `tenzir -f <file>`, which
loads and executes the pipeline defined in the given file.

The pipeline parser now emits helpful and visually pleasing diagnostics.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#3223](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3223).

#### Implement the `serve` operator and `/serve` endpoint

The `serve` operator and `/serve` endpoint supersede the experimental `/query`
endpoint. The operator is a sink for events, and bridges a pipeline into a
RESTful interface from which events can be pulled incrementally.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3180](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3180).

#### Apply the changes from the new `pipeline_manager` plugin

The new *pipeline-manager* is a proprietary plugin that allows for creating,
updating and persisting pipelines.
The included RESTful interface allows for easy access and modification of these
pipelines.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#3164](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3164).

#### Implement a fallback parser mechanism for extensions that don't have â€¦

The `json` parser now servers as a fallback parser for all files whose
extension do not have any default parser in Tenzir.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#3422](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3422).

#### Avoid crashing when reading a pre-2.0 partition

The `flatten [<separator>]` operator flattens nested data structures by joining
nested records with the specified separator (defaults to `.`) and merging lists.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3018](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3018).

#### PRs 3128-3173-3193

The sink operator `import` persists events in a VAST node.

The source operator `export` retrieves events from a VAST node.

The `repeat` operator repeats its input a given number of times.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3128](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3128).

#### Improve metrics (and some other things)

The `sort` operator now also works for `ip` and `enum` fields.

`tenzir --dump-metrics '<pipeline>'` prints a performance overview of the
executed pipeline on stderr at the end.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3390](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3390).

#### A collection of minor UX improvements

The `--timeout` option for the `vast status` command allows for defining how
long VAST waits for components to report their status. The option defaults to 10
seconds.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#3162](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3162).

#### Unroll the Zeek TSV header parsing loop

The `zeek-tsv` parser sometimes failed to parse Zeek TSV logs, wrongly
reporting that the header ended too early. This bug no longer exists.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#3291](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3291).

### Changes

#### Rename package artifacts from vast to tenzir

The Debian package for Tenzir replaces previous VAST installations and attempts
to migrate existing data from VAST to Tenzir in the process. You can opt-out of
this migration by creating the file `/var/lib/vast/disable-migration`.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#3203](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3203).

#### Change Arrow extension type and metadata prefixes

We now register extension types as `tenzir.ip`, `tenzir.subnet`, and
`tenzir.enumeration` instead of `vast.address`, `vast.subnet`, and
`vast.enumeration`, respectively. Arrow schema metadata now has a `TENZIR:`
prefix instead of a `VAST:` prefix.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3208](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3208).

#### Introduce the `tenzir` and `tenzird` binaries

VAST is now called Tenzir. The `tenzir` binary replaces `vast exec` to execute a
pipeline. The `tenzird` binary replaces `vast start` to start a node. The
`tenzirctl` binary continues to offer all functionality that `vast` previously
offered until all commands have been migrated to pipeline operators.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3187](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3187).

#### Delete `delete_when_stopped` from the pipeline manager

The `delete_when_stopped` flag was removed from the pipeline manager REST API.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#3292](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3292).

#### Transform `read` and `write` into `parse` and `print`

The `parse` and `print` operators have been renamed to `read` and `write`,
respectively. The `read ... [from ...]` and `write ... [to ...]` operators
are not available anymore. If you did not specify a connector, you can
continue using `read ...` and `write ...` in many cases. Otherwise, use
`from ... [read ...]` and `to ... [write ...]` instead.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#3365](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3365).

#### Rename `#type` to `#schema` and introduce `#schema_id`

The `#type` meta extractor was renamed to `#schema`.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#3183](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3183).

#### Tune defaults and demo-node experience

We reduced the default `batch-timeout` from ten seconds to one second in to
improve the user experience of interactive pipelines with data aquisition.

We reduced the default `active-partition-timeout` from 5 minutes to 30 seconds
to reduce the time until data is persisted.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#3320](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3320).

#### Remove old commands

The `stop` command no longer exists. Shut down VAST nodes using CTRL-C instead.

The `version` command no longer exists. Use the more powerful `version` pipeline
operator instead.

The `spawn source` and `spawn sink` commands no longer exist. To import data
remotely, run a pipeline in the form of `remote from â€¦ | â€¦ | import`, and to
export data remotely, run a pipeline in the form of `export | â€¦ | remote to â€¦`.

The lower-level `peer`, `kill`, and `send` commands no longer exist.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3166](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3166).

#### Remove `lsvast`

The debugging utility `lsvast` no longer exists. Pipelines replace most of its
functionality.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3211](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3211).

#### Revamp packet acquisition and parsing

We reimplemented the old `pcap` plugin as a format. The command `tenzir-ctl
import pcap` no longer works. Instead, the new `pcap` plugin provides a parser
that emits `pcap.packet` events, as well as a printer that generates a PCAP file
when provided with these events.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#3263](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3263).

#### Add colors to JSON printer

We removed the `--pretty` option from the `json` printer. This option is now the
default. To switch to NDJSON, use `-c|--compact-output`.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#3343](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3343).

#### Change `summarize` to operate across schemas

The aggregation functions in a `summarize` operator can now receive only a
single extractor instead of multiple ones.

The behavior for absent columns and aggregations across multiple schemas was
changed.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#3250](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3250).

#### Remove the `prefix()` function from the REST endpoint plugin API

We removed the `rest_endpoint_plugin::prefix()` function from
the public API of the `rest_endpoint_plugin` class. For a migration,
existing users should prepend the prefix manually to all endpoints
defined by their plugin.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#3221](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3221).

#### Implement the `serve` operator and `/serve` endpoint

The default port of the web plugin changed from 42001 to 5160. This change
avoids collisions from dynamic port allocation on Linux systems.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3180](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3180).

#### Switch /status to POST

The HTTP method of the status endpoint in the experimental REST API is now `POST`.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#3194](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3194).

#### Add diagnostics (and some other improvements)

We changed the default connector of `read <format>` and `write <format>` for
all formats to `stdin` and `stdout`, respectively.

We removed language plugins in favor of operator-based integrations.

The interface of the operator, loader, parser, printer and saver plugins was
changed.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#3223](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3223).

#### Improve low-load memory consumption

The default interval between two automatic rebuilds is now set to 2 hours and
can be configured with the `rebuild-interval` option.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#3377](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3377).

#### Remove previously deprecated options

The previously deprecated options `tenzir.pipelines` (replaced with
`tenzir.operators`) and `tenzir.pipeline-triggers` (no replacement) no longer
exist.

The previously deprecated deprecated types `addr`, `count`, `int`, and `real`
(replaced with `ip`, `uint64`, `int64`, and `double`, respectively) no longer
exist.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3358](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3358).

#### Rename default database directory to `tenzir.db`

The default database directory moved from `vast.db` to `tenzir.db`. Use the
option `tenzir.db-directory` to manually set the database directory path.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3212](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3212).

### Bug Fixes

#### Fix shutdown of sources and importer

Import processes sometimes failed to shut down automatically when the node
exited. They now shut down reliably.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3207](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3207).

#### Fix rare crash when transforming sliced nested arrays

Using transformation operators like `summarize`, `sort`, `put`, `extend`, or
`replace` no longer sometimes crashes after a preceding `head` or `tail`
operator when referencing a nested field.

The `tail` operator sometimes returned more events than specified. This no
longer happens.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3171](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3171).

#### Add a changelog entry for the compaction fix

We fixed a bug in the compation plugin that prevented it from applying the
configured weights when it was used for the first time on a database.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#3185](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3185).

#### Fix reconnect attempts for remote pipelines

Starting a remote pipeline with `vast exec` failed when the node was not
reachable yet. Like other commands, executing a pipeline now waits until the
node is reachable before starting.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#3188](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/3188).
