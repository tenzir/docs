### Features

#### Enable selective deletion of lookup table entries

For `lookup-table` contexts, the new `--erase` option for `context update`
enables selective deletion of lookup table entries.

The `context update` operator now defaults the `--key <field>` option to the
first field in the input when no field is explicitly specified.

#### Add percentile aggregation functions

The `p99`, `p95`, `p90`, `p75`, and `p50` aggregation functions calculate
commonly used percentiles of grouped values in the `summarize` operator.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#4273](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4273).

#### Support multiple publishers

The `publish` operator's topics no longer have to be unique. Instead, any number
of pipelines may use the `publish` operator with the same topic. This enables
multi-producer, multi-consumer (MPMC) event routing, where streams of events
from different pipelines can now be merged back together in addition to being
split.

Inter-pipeline data transfer with the `publish` and `subscribe` operators is now
as fast as intra-pipeline data transfer between pipeline operators and utilizes
the same amount of memory.

Back pressure now propagates from subscribers back to publishers, i.e., if a
pipeline with a `subscribe` operator is too slow then all pipelines with
matching `publish` operators will be slowed down to a matching speed. This
limits the memory usage of `publish` operators and prevents data loss.

### Changes

#### Add percentile aggregation functions

The `approximate_median` aggregation function is now called `median`. We found
the longer name, despite being more accurate, to be rather unintuitive.

### Bug Fixes

#### Handle loading of configured and non-configured contexts with the same name

Configured and non-configured contexts with the same name will not cause
non-deterministic behavior upon loading anymore. The node will shut down
instead.

By [@Dakostu](https://github.com/Dakostu) in [#4224](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/4224).

#### Evaluate `ip == subnet` predicates

Predicates of the form `ip == subnet` and `ip in [subnet1, subnet2, â€¦]` now
work as expected.

The `lookup` operator now correctly handles subnet keys when using the `--retro`
or `--snapshot` options.
