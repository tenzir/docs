Fix edge cases for moving fields when using the `move` keyword in the `where`
and `map` functions.

### Bug Fixes

#### Fix `map(move foo, name, expr)`

The `move` keyword now works as expected for the first positional argument of
the `map` and `where` functions.

#### Enable `to_gogle_cloud_logging` for the Nix builds

The `to_google_cloud_logging` operator was not available in static binary builds
due to an oversight. This is now fixed.
