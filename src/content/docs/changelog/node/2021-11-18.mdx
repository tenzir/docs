### Features

#### PRs 1929-1947

The export command now has a `--low-priority` option to reduce the priority of
the request while query backlogs are being worked down.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#1929](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1929).

#### Partition transforms

A new 'apply' handler in the index gives plugin authors the ability to
apply transforms over entire partitions. Previously, transforms were
limited to streams of table slice during import or export.

By [@lava](https://github.com/lava) in [#1887](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1887).

#### Add metrics to the index

The keys `query.backlog.normal` and `query.backlog.low` have been added to the
metrics output. The values indicate the number of quries that are currently in
the backlog.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#1942](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1942).

### Changes

#### Introduce a query backlog in the index

The `max-queries` configuration option now works at a coarser granularity. It
used to limit the number of queries that could simultaneously retrieve data,
but it now sets the number of queries that can be processed at the same time.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#1896](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1896).

#### Update xxHash and hashing APIs

VAST no longer vendors [xxHash](https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash), which is
now a regular required dependency. Internally, VAST switched its default hash
function to XXH3, providing a speedup of up to 3x.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#1905](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1905).

#### Bump minimum required CMake version to 3.18

Building VAST from source now requires CMake 3.18+.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1914](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1914).

#### Prefer reading query from stdin if available

A recently added features allows for exporting everything when no query is
provided. We've restricted this to prefer reading a query from stdin if
available. Additionally, conflicting ways to read the query now trigger errors.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1917](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1917).

### Bug Fixes

#### Automatically add the skip attribute to records in lists

VAST no longer tries to create indexes for fields of type `list<record{...}>` as
that wasn't supported in the first place.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#1933](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1933).

#### Increase the partition erase timeout to 1 minute

The timeout duration to delete partitions has been increased to one minute,
reducing the frequency of warnings for hitting this timeout significantly.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#1897](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1897).

#### Change `suricata.dns` schema to match current DNS structure

The `suricata.dns` schema has been updated to match the currently used
EVE-JSON structure output by recent Suricata versions.

By [@satta](https://github.com/satta) in [#1919](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1919).

#### Load static plugins only when enabled

Static plugins are no longer always loaded, but rather need to be explicitly
enabled as documented. To restore the behavior from before this bug fix, set
`vast.plugins: [bundled]` in your configuration file.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#1959](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1959).

#### Update xxHash and hashing APIs

When reading IPv6 addresses from PCAP data, only the first 4 bytes have been
considered. VAST now stores all 16 bytes.

By [@mavam](https://github.com/mavam) in [#1905](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1905).

#### Fix deletion of segments if CWD != dbdir

Store files now get deleted correctly if the database directory differs from the
working directory.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#1912](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1912).

#### Avoid references to record fields in fill_status_map

Debug builds of VAST no longer segfault on a status request with the `--debug`
option.

By [@tobim](https://github.com/tobim) in [#1915](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/1915).
