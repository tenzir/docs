### Features

#### Add a few new aggregation functions for TQL2

We added three new, TQL2-exclusive aggregation functions: `first`, `last`, and
`mode`. The functions return the first, last, and most common non-null value per
group, respectively.

### Bug Fixes

#### Implement `and` and `or` for `null_type`

The boolean operators `and`/`or` now work correctly for the type `null`.
Previously, `null and false` evaluated to `null`, and a warning was emitted.
Now, it evaluates to `false` without a warning.

#### Ensure cache directory is writable for multiple users

Using the `tenzir` process from multiple users on the same host sometimes failed
because the cache directory was not writable for all users. This no longer
happens.

#### Return instantly in `/serve` if pipeline fails early

The `/serve` endpoint now returns instantly when its pipeline fails before the
endpoint is used for the first time. In the Tenzir Platform this causes the load
more button in the Explorer to correctly stop showing for pipelines that fail
shortly after starting.
