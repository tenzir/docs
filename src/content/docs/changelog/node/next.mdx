### Features

#### HTTP request body encoding

The `from_http` and `http` operators now support using `record` values for the
request `body` parameter. By default, the record is serialized as JSON. You can
also specify `encode="form"` to send the body as URL-encoded form data. When
using `form` encoding, nested fields are flattened using dot notation (e.g.,
`foo: {bar: "baz"}` => `foo.bar=baz`). This supersedes the `payload` parameter,
which therefore is now deprecated.

###### Examples

By default, setting `body` to a record will JSON-encode it:

```tql
http "https://api.example.com/data", body={foo: "bar", count: 42}
```
```http
POST /data HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 33

{
  "foo": "bar",
  "count": 42
}
```

To change the encoding, you can use the `encode` option:

```tql
http "https://api.example.com/data",
  body={foo: {bar: "baz"}, count: 42},
  encode="form"
```
```http
POST /data HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 20

foo.bar=baz&count=42
```

Arbitrary body contents can be sent by using a string or blob:

```tql
http "https://api.example.com/data", body="hello world!"
```
```http
POST /data HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
Content-Length: 12

hello world!
```

#### IP address categorization functions

Ever wondered if that suspicious traffic is coming from inside the corporate
network? 🏢 We've got you covered with a new suite of IP address classification
functions that make network analysis a breeze.

**`is_private()`** - Quickly spot internal RFC 1918 addresses in your logs.
Perfect for identifying lateral movement or distinguishing between internal and
external threats:

```tql
where src_ip.is_private() and dst_ip.is_global()
// Catch data exfiltration attempts from your internal network
```

**`is_global()`** - Find publicly routable addresses. Essential for tracking
external attackers or monitoring outbound connections:

```tql
where src_ip.is_global() and failed_login_count > 5
// Detect brute force attempts from the internet
```

**`is_multicast()`** - Identify multicast traffic (224.0.0.0/4, ff00::/8).
Great for spotting mDNS, SSDP, and other broadcast protocols that shouldn't
cross network boundaries:

```tql
where dst_ip.is_multicast() and src_ip.is_global()
// Flag suspicious multicast from external sources
```

**`is_link_local()`** - Detect link-local addresses (169.254.0.0/16,
fe80::/10). Useful for identifying misconfigurations or APIPA fallback:

```tql
where server_ip.is_link_local()
// Find services accidentally binding to link-local addresses
```

**`is_loopback()`** - Spot loopback addresses (127.0.0.0/8, ::1). Hunt for
suspicious local connections or tunneled traffic:

```tql
where src_ip != dst_ip and dst_ip.is_loopback()
// Unusual loopback connections might indicate malware
```

**`ip_category()`** - Get the complete classification in one shot. Returns:
"global", "private", "multicast", "link_local", "loopback", "broadcast", or
"unspecified":

```tql
where src_ip.ip_category() == "private" and dst_ip.ip_category() == "multicast"
// Analyze traffic patterns by IP category
```

These functions work seamlessly with both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, making them
future-proof for your dual-stack environments. Happy hunting! 🔍

#### Compression for `write_bitz`

Tenzir's internal wire format, which is accessible through the `read_bitz` and
`write_bitz` operators, now uses Zstd compression internally, resulting in a
significantly smaller output size. This change is backwards-compatible.

### Changes

#### Respecting error responses from Azure Log Analytics

The `to_azure_log_analytics` operator now emits an error when it receives any
response considering an internal error. Those normally indicate configuration
errors and the pipeline will now stop with an error instead of continuing to
send data that will not be received correctly.

#### `kv` parser no longer produces empty fields

Our Key-Value parsers (the `read_kv` operator and `parse_kv` function) previously
produced empty values if the `value_split` was not found.

With this change, a "field" missing a `value_split` is considered an extension
of the previous fields value instead:

```tql
from \
  {input: "x=1 y=2 z=3 4 5 a=6"},
this = { ...input.parse_kv() }
```
Previous result:
```tql
{x:1, y:2, z:"3", "4":"", "5":"", a:6}
```
New result:
```tql
{x:1, y:2, z:"3 4 5", a:6}
```

### Bug Fixes

#### Fix `http` operator pagination

The `http` operator dropped all provided HTTP headers after the first request
when performing paginated requests. The operator now preserves the headers for
all requests.
