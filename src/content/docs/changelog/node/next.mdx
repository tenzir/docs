### Features

#### Receive UDP datagrams as events

The new `from_udp` operator receives UDP datagrams and outputs structured events
containing both the data and peer information.

Unlike `load_udp` which outputs raw bytes, `from_udp` produces events with
metadata about the sender, making it ideal for security monitoring and network
analysis where knowing the source of each datagram is important.

Each received datagram becomes an event with this structure:

```tql
from_udp "0.0.0.0:1234"
```

```tql
{
  data: "Hello, UDP!\n",
  peer: {
    ip: 192.168.1.100,
    port: 54321,
  },
}
```

Enable hostname resolution for DNS lookups (disabled by default for performance):

```tql
from_udp "0.0.0.0:1234", resolve_hostnames=true
```

```tql
{
  data: "Hello, UDP!\n",
  peer: {
    ip: 192.168.1.100,
    port: 54321,
    hostname: "client.example.com",
  },
}
```

### Changes

#### Amazon Security Lake

We have made two convenience changes to the `to_amazon_security_lake` operator:

* The `role` parameter now defaults to the automatically generated role for the
  custom source in Security Lake. If you are using a different role, you can
  still specify it.
* The operator now uses UUIDv7 for the names of the files written into the
  Security Lake's blob storage. Since UUIDv7 is time ordered, inspecting the
  files in the lake becomes slightly easier.
