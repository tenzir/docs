Unreleased changes.

### Features

#### Add an option to add extra headers to the platform request

The new option `tenzir.platform-extra-headers` causes the Tenzir Node to add the given extra HTTP headers when
establishing the connection to the Tenzir Platform, for example to pass additional authentication headers
when traversing proxies.

You can set this variable either via configuration file:

```yaml
tenzir:
  platform-extra-headers:
    Authentication: Bearer XXXX
    Proxy-Authentication: Bearer YYYY
```

or as environment variable: (note the double underscore before the name of the header)

```sh
TENZIR_PLATFORM_EXTRA_HEADERS__AUTHENTICATION="Bearer XXXX"
TENZIR_PLATFORM_EXTRA_HEADERS__PROXY_AUTHENTICATION="Bearer YYYY"
```

When using the environment variable version, the Tenzir Node always converts the name of the header to lowercase
and converts underscores to dashes, so a header specified as `TENZIR_PLATFORM_EXTRA_HEADERS__EXTRA_HEADER=extra`
will be sent as `extra-header: extra` in the HTTP request.

#### Support for OCSF extensions

The `ocsf::apply` operator now supports OCSF extensions. This means that
`metadata.extensions` is now also taken into account for casting and validation.
At the moment, only the extensions versioned together with OCSF are supported.
This includes the `win` and `linux` extensions.

### Changes

#### TQL2 support in compaction plugin

The pipelines defined as part of the compaction configuration can now use TQL2.
For backwards-compatibility, TQL1 pipelines still work, but they are deprecated
and emit a warning on start-up.
