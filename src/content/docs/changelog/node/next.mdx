### Changes

#### Respecting error responses from Azure Log Analytics

The `to_azure_log_analytics` operator now emits an error when it receives any
response considering an internal error. Those normally indicate configuration
errors and the pipeline will now stop with an error instead of continuing to
send data that will not be received correctly.

#### `kv` parser no longer produces empty fields

Our Key-Value parsers (the `read_kv` operator and `parse_kv` function) previously
produced empty values if the `value_split` was not found.

With this change, a "field" missing a `value_split` is considered an extension
of the previous fields value instead:

```tql
from \
  {input: "x=1 y=2 z=3 4 5 a=6"},
this = { ...input.parse_kv() }
```
Previous result:
```tql
{x:1, y:2, z:"3", "4":"", "5":"", a:6}
```
New result:
```tql
{x:1, y:2, z:"3 4 5", a:6}
```

### Bug Fixes

#### Fix `http` operator pagination

The `http` operator dropped all provided HTTP headers after the first request
when performing paginated requests. The operator now preserves the headers for
all requests.
