Unreleased changes.

### Changes

#### Easier multi-key deduplication

We now support multiple keys for deduplication, e.g., `deduplicate a, b.c, d`
is now equivalent to the previously unwieldy expression `deduplicate {x: a, y:
b.c, z: d}`.

### Bug Fixes

#### Gracefully handle server errors in the web plugin

The node now prints a proper error message in case the builtin web server can't start because the port is already in use.
