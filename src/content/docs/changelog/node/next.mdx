### Features

#### Handling HTTP error status codes

The `from_http` and `http` operators now provide an `error_field` option that
lets you specify a field to receive the error response as a `blob`. When you set
this option, the operators keep events with status codes outside the 200â€“399
range so you can handle them manually.

### Bug Fixes

#### Fixed issue with table creation in `to_clickhouse`

Multiple `to_clickhouse` operators can now attempt to create the same ClickHouse
table at the same time without an error.
