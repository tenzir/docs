Unreleased changes.

### Features

#### Send data to Kafka topics with `to_kafka`

The new `to_kafka` operator allows you to send one Kafka message per event,
making it easier to integrate Tenzir with tools that rely on the 1:1 correlation
between messages and events.

**Examples**

Use `to_kafka` to send JSON events to a topic:

```tql
subscribe "logs"
to_kafka "events", message=this.print_json()
```

Send specific field values with custom keys for partitioning:

```tql
subscribe "alerts"
to_kafka "metrics", message=alert_msg, key="server-01"
```

#### `insert_separator` option for `load_zmq`

The `load_zmq` operator now supports an optional `insert_separator` parameter to append
a custom string to each received ZeroMQ message. This enables better message
separation and parsing for downstream operators.
