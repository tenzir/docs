## ‚ú® Features

### Implement `http` operator

We implemented the `http` operator that allows making HTTP/1.1 requests to a
URL. The operator also allows paginate APIs based on the responses.

### Introduce lambda functions

TQL now supports lambda expressions. They are supported in the `where` and `map`
functions on list, and on the newly added `count_if` aggregation function.
Instead of `[1, 2, 3].map(x, x + 1)`, use `[1, 2, 3].map(x => x + 1)`. This
subtle change makes it obvious that the expression is not evaluated on the
entire list, but rather on each element individually.

The `count_if` aggregation function counts the number of elements in a list that
satisfy a given predicate. For example, `[1, 2, 3].count_if(x => x > 1)` returns
`2`.

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Fix a segfault in `save_amqp` on connection loss

was lost.

### Fix overflow warning for `-9223372036854775808`

The lowest 64-bit integer, `-9223372036854775808`, no longer causes an overflow
warning.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#5223](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5223).

### Introduce lambda functions

The expression `null if true else 42` previously returned `42`. It now correctly
returns `null`.
