### Features

#### `from_azure_blob_storage` operator

The new `from_azure_blob_storage` operator works similarly to `from_file` but
supports additional Azure Blob Storage specific options.

For example, you can set the `account_key`:
```tql
from_azure_blob_storage "abfs://container/data/*.csv", account_key="your-account-key"
```

#### Dynamic `namespace` and retry logic for `to_google_secops`

The `to_google_secops` operator now retries requests which fail with a `5XX` or
a `429` status code. Additionally, the `namespace` option of the operator now
supports all expressions that evaluate to a `string`.
