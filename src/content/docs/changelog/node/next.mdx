Unreleased changes.

### Features

#### Support for OCSF v1.7.0

Tenzir now supports the newly released OCSF version 1.7.0.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#5580](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5580).

### Changes

#### Easier multi-key deduplication

We now support multiple keys for deduplication, e.g., `deduplicate a, b.c, d`
is now equivalent to the previously unwieldy expression `deduplicate {x: a, y:
b.c, z: d}`.

### Bug Fixes

#### Backpressure in `publish` and `subscribe`

Previously, the backpressure mechanism in `publish` and `subscribe` was not
working as intended. Thus, publishing pipelines continued processing data
even when downstream consumers were lagging far behind. This is now fixed. As a
result, memory consumption for pipelines connected by `publish` and `subscribe`
is reduced significantly in those cases.

#### Gracefully handle server errors in the web plugin

The node now prints a proper error message in case the builtin web server can't start because the port is already in use.

#### Fixed a race in concurrent function application

We fixed a race condition in case multiple pipelines used the same
transformation on the same data, such as string manipulations in where clauses
to filter the input. The bug caused those pipelines to fail sporadically.
