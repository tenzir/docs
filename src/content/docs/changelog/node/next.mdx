Unreleased changes.

### Changes

#### Better kafka diagnostics

The `kafka` related operators now emit more diagnostics in unexpected
situations, providing more information to diagnose problems.

By [@raxyte](https://github.com/raxyte) in [#5490](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5490).

#### Better defaults for `load_kafka`

The `load_kafka` operators previously used `offset="end"` as the default, which
meant that it always started from the end of the topic. This default was now
changed to `"stored"`, such that the previously commited offset is used instead.

### Bug Fixes

#### `session_name` and `external_id` in `aws_iam` options

The `load_kafka`, `save_kafka` and `to_kafka` operators now accept configuring
`session_name` and `external_id` for `aws_iam` options.

By [@raxyte](https://github.com/raxyte) in [#5481](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5481).

#### Behavior of the `throttle` operator

The `throttle` operator now correctly forwards its data in a timely manner.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#5488](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5488).

#### Hang in `every` and `cron`

We fixed a bug in `every` and `cron` operators that could cause them to hang
and panic with assertions failures.
