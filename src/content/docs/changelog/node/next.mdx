### Features

#### Support GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT environment variable in `to_google_cloud_logging` operator

The `to_google_cloud_logging` operator now checks for the `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` environment variable
if no explicit project id is given, before falling back to the Google Metadata service.

#### Getting Kafka records with `from_kafka`

The new `from_kafka` operator allows you to receive one event per Kafka message,
thus keeping the event boundary unlike `load_kafka`, which has now been
deprecated.

**Example**

Use `from_kafka` to parse JSON events from a topic:

```tql
from_kafka "events"
this = message.parse_json()
```

### Bug Fixes

#### Fixed an assertion failure in parsers

We fixed a bug in a common component used across all parsers, which could enter
an inconsistent state, leading to an "unexpected internal error: unreachable".
