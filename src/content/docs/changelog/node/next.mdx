### Features

#### Support GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT environment variable in `to_google_cloud_logging` operator

The `to_google_cloud_logging` operator now checks for the `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` environment variable
if no explicit project id is given, before falling back to the Google Metadata service.

### Bug Fixes

#### Fixed an assertion failure in parsers

We fixed a bug in a common component used across all parsers, which could enter
an inconsistent state, leading to an "unexpected internal error: unreachable".
