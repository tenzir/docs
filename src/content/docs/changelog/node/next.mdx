### Features

#### Format strings

TQL now supports format strings as you might know them from other languages like
Python. Format strings allow you to flexibly construct strings in a very
succinct way by using a pair of braces within an `f"…"` string.

For example, assume that you have events with two integer fields, `found` and
`total`. We can construct a message from this as follows:

```tql
percent = round(found / total * 100).string()
message = "Found " + found.string() + "/" + total.string() + " => " + percent + "%"
```

Using the new format strings, this simply becomes

```tql
percent = round(found / total * 100)
message = f"Found {found}/{total} => {percent}%"
```

You can also use arbitrary expressions inside `{` to simplify this even further:

```tql
message = f"Found {found}/{total} => {round(found / total * 100)}%"
```

If you ever need an actual `{` in your format string, you can use `{{`. The same
goes for the closing brace `}`, which needs to be written as `}}` within format
strings.

### Changes

#### Remove `meta` keyword

The identifier `meta` is no longer a keyword and can thus now be used as a
normal field name.

### Bug Fixes

#### Gracefully handle null values when charting with resolution

The `chart_bar` and `chart_pie` operators had a bug when the x-axis had a
`null` value and the `resolution` option was specified. The unfortunate panic
due to this bug has now been fixed.

#### Pipeline activity refresh without running pipelines

The `pipeline::activity` operator now always yields new events, even when all
running pipelines are hidden.

#### Invalid scientific notation when using `write_json`

When using `write_json` with large floating-point numbers, the resulting JSON
was ill-formed. For example, the number `5483819555176798000.0` was previously
printed as `5.483819555176798e+18.0`. The extra `.0` at the end is not valid
JSON. Thus, the output was rejected by some parsers. Now, `write_json` renders
this number as `5.483819555176798e+18` instead.

This bug was also observable on the Tenzir Platform, where it could lead to
request timeouts. Now, large numbers are shown correctly.

By [@jachris](https://github.com/jachris) in [#5274](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5274).

#### Unreliable `where` diagnostics

The `where` operator now correctly produces diagnostics also for simple
expressions, which was previously not the case in some situations.
