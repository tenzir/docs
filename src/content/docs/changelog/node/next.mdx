Unreleased changes.

### Features

#### `read_delimited` and `read_delimited_regex`

TQL now supports two new operators for parsing data streams with custom
delimiters: `read_delimited` and `read_delimited_regex`. These operators provide a more
intuitive and discoverable way to split data on custom separators compared to
the deprecated `split_at_regex` option in `read_lines`.

The `read_delimited` operator splits input on exact string or blob matches:

```tql
load_file "data.txt"
read_delimited "||"
```

The `read_delimited_regex` operator splits input using regular expression patterns:

```tql
load_tcp "0.0.0.0:514" {
  read_delimited_regex "(?=<[0-9]+>)"
}
```

Both operators support binary data processing and optionally including the
separator in the output. The `split_at_regex` option in `read_lines` is now
deprecated in favor of these dedicated operators.

#### HTTP request metadata

The `from_http` operator now supports the `metadata_field` option when using the
server mode and not just client mode. The request metadata has the following
schema:

| Field                | Type     | Description                           |
| :------------------- | :------- | :------------------------------------ |
| `headers`            | `record` | The request headers.                 |
| `query`              | `record` | The query parameters of the request.  |
| `path`               | `string` | The path requested.                   |
| `fragment`           | `string` | The URI fragment of the request.      |
| `method`             | `string` | The HTTP method of the request.       |
| `version`            | `string` | The HTTP version of the request.      |

### Bug Fixes

#### Fixed panic in `write_parquet`

The `write_parquet` operator no longer panics when specifying
`compression_type="snappy"` without a `compression_level`.
