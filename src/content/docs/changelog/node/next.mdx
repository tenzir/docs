### Features

#### Format strings

TQL now supports format strings as you might know them from other languages like
Python. Format strings allow you to flexibly construct strings in a very
succinct way by using a pair of braces within an `f"â€¦"` string.

For example, assume that you have events with two integer fields, `found` and
`total`. We can construct a message from this as follows:

```tql
percent = round(found / total * 100).string()
message = "Found " + found.string() + "/" + total.string() + " => " + percent + "%"
```

Using the new format strings, this simply becomes

```tql
percent = round(found / total * 100)
message = f"Found {found}/{total} => {percent}%"
```

You can also use arbitrary expressions inside `{` to simplify this even further:

```tql
message = f"Found {found}/{total} => {round(found / total * 100)}%"
```

If you ever need an actual `{` in your format string, you can use `{{`. The same
goes for the closing brace `}`, which needs to be written as `}}` within format
strings.

### Changes

#### Remove `meta` keyword

The identifier `meta` is no longer a keyword and can thus now be used as a
normal field name.

### Bug Fixes

#### Gracefully handle null values when charting with resolution

The `chart_bar` and `chart_pie` operators had a bug when the x-axis had a
`null` value and the `resolution` option was specified. The unfortunate panic
due to this bug has now been fixed.
