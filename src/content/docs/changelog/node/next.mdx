Unreleased changes.

### Changes

#### Memory usage when importing

We optimized the memory usage of buffered synopses, which are used internally
when building indexes while importing events. The optimization significantly
reduces memory consumption by not performing copies of strings and IPs, roughly
cutting the memory usage of the underlying component in half.

#### Expose one-level recursion for OCSF objects

We now support recursive OCSF objects at depth one, as opposed to dropping
recursive objects entirely. For example, pipelines can safely follow
relationships such as `process.parent_process` or `analytic.related_analytics`:

```tql
from {
  metadata: {version: "1.5.0"},
  class_uid: 1007,
  process: {
    pid: 1234,
    parent_process: {
      pid: 5678,
    },
  },
}
ocsf::apply

// New!
assert process.parent_process.pid == 5678
assert not process.parent_process.has("parent_process")
```

The first assertion now succeeds while deeper ancestry is trimmed
automatically, preserving schema compatibility for downstream consumers.
