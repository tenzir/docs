Unreleased changes.

### Changes

#### More permissive syslog parsing

The parser for RFC 5424 syslog messages now accepts structured data that
slightly diverges from the RFC 5424 specification. In particular, quotes and
other special characters are allowed in values unless it's ambiguous where they
belong to.

### Bug Fixes

#### Fixed a shutdown crash in `save_tcp`

while shutting down.

#### Error reporting in `load_balance`

The `load_balance` operator now correctly reports errors that happen during the
actual execution.
