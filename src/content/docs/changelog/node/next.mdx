### Features

#### Send data to Kafka topics with `to_kafka`

The new `to_kafka` operator allows you to send one Kafka message per event,
making it easier to integrate Tenzir with tools that rely on the 1:1 correlation
between messages and events.

**Examples**

Use `to_kafka` to send JSON events to a topic:

```tql
subscribe "logs"
to_kafka "events", message=this.print_json()
```

Send specific field values with custom keys for partitioning:

```tql
subscribe "alerts"
to_kafka "metrics", message=alert_msg, key="server-01"
```

#### `insert_separator` option for `load_zmq`

The `load_zmq` operator now supports an optional `insert_separator` parameter to append
a custom string to each received ZeroMQ message. This enables better message
separation and parsing for downstream operators.

### Changes

#### Use UUIDv7 for file naming in `to_hive` operator

The `to_hive` operator now uses UUIDv7 instead of consecutive numbers for file naming within partitions. This change provides guaranteed uniqueness across concurrent processes and natural time-based ordering of files, preventing filename conflicts when multiple processes write to the same partition simultaneously.

Example output paths changed from:
- `/partition/1.json`
- `/partition/2.json`
To:
- `/partition/01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef.json`
- `/partition/01234568-cd01-2345-6789-abcdef012345.json`

UUIDv7 combines the benefits of timestamp-based ordering with collision resistance, making it ideal for distributed data processing scenarios.
