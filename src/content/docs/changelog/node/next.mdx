### Bug Fixes

#### Fixed excessive memory allocation

We have switched the allocator back to the system allocator for now, as the
`mimalloc` setup led to significant memory usage issues on some systems.

Furthermore, we added quite a few experimental memory-usage related metrics to
`metrics "memory"`, providing additional insight into the memory usage of
Tenzir.
