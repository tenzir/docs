Unreleased changes.

### Features

#### Grouped enumeration

The `enumerate` operator now supports a `group` option to enumerate events
separately based on a value.

For example, to have a field act as a counter for a value, use the following
pipeline:

```tql
from {x: 1}, {x: 2}, {x: "1"}, {x: 2}
enumerate count, group=x
count = count + 1
```

```tql
{
  count: 1,
  x: 1,
}
{
  count: 1,
  x: 2,
}
{
  count: 1,
  x: "1",
}
{
  count: 2,
  x: 2,
}
```

#### Lambdas in `map` and `where` can capture surrounding fields

Lambda expressions in the `map` and `where` functions can now capture and access fields from
the surrounding context, enabling more powerful data transformations.

For example:

```tql
from {
  host: "server1",
  ports: [80, 443, 8080]
}
ports = ports.map(p => {host: host, port: p})
```

```tql
{
  host: "server1",
  ports: [
    {
      host: "server1",
      port: 80,
    },
    {
      host: "server1",
      port: 443,
    },
    {
      host: "server1",
      port: 8080,
    },
  ],
}
```

### Changes

#### Keep zeek TSV logs as-is in `read_zeek_tsv`

Parsing Zeek TSV logs no longer attempts to cast the parsed events to a shipped Zeek schema.
