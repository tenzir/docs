Unreleased changes.

### Changes

#### Improved `export` memory management

The database partitions opened by the `export` operator previously read and
forwarded their entire contents to `export` without waiting for the operator to
forward them. This circumvented the usual backpressure mechanism and could lead
to unexpectedly high memory usage. Now, the backpressure is propagated to the
underlying storage layer.

#### Improved pipeline execution

We fine-tuned the scheduling logic responsible for the execution of pipelines.
In particular, certain pipelines that invoke parsing functions now take
significantly less memory to run.
