## Bug Fixes

### Properly recover corrupted partition data on startup

VAST now properly regenerates any corrupted, oversized partitions it encounters
during startup, provided that the corresponding store files are available. These
files could be produced by versions up to and including VAST v2.2, when using
configurations with an increased maximum partition size.

### Abort the response promise if running into oversized partitions

We fixed an indefinite hang that occurred when attempting to apply a pipeline to
a partition that is not a valid flatbuffer.
