This release improves the integration with Google Cloud Logging.

Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/releases/tag/v5.1.2).

### Changes

#### Split out `name` option and use metadata server when unset

We split the `name` option of `to_google_cloud_logging`, no longer requiring
user to construct the ID manually.

### Bug Fixes

#### Delay catalog lookups until catalog is ready

The `export`, `metrics`, `diagnostics` and `partitions` operators returned an
empty result when used before the node had successfully loaded its persisted
data. They now wait correctly.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#5156](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5156).

#### Always shut down the pipeline manager first

We fixed a very rare bug that on shutdown could mark running pipelines as
stopped, completed, or failed, causing the pipelines not to restart alongside
the node.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#5163](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5163).

#### Do not refuse startup when `pid.lock` is invalid

The node no longer refuses to start when its last shutdown happened in the brief
period on startup after its PID file was created and before it was flushed.

By [@dominiklohmann](https://github.com/dominiklohmann) in [#5164](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/pull/5164).

#### Split out `name` option and use metadata server when unset

The `to_google_cloud_logging` operator is now available in both Docker and static
builds. The operator had earlier been missing due to a configuration issue.
