## 🔄 Changes

### Split out `name` option and use metadata server when unset

We split the `name` option of `to_google_cloud_logging`, no longer requiring
user to construct the ID manually.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Delay catalog lookups until catalog is ready

The `export`, `metrics`, `diagnostics` and `partitions` operators returned an
empty result when used before the node had successfully loaded its persisted
data. They now wait correctly.

### Always shut down the pipeline manager first

We fixed a very rare bug that on shutdown could mark running pipelines as
stopped, completed, or failed, causing the pipelines not to restart alongside
the node.

### Do not refuse startup when `pid.lock` is invalid

The node no longer refuses to start when its last shutdown happened in the brief
period on startup after its PID file was created and before it was flushed.

### Split out `name` option and use metadata server when unset

The `to_google_cloud_logging` operator is now available in both Docker and static
builds. The operator had earlier been missing due to a configuration issue.
