This release includes a variety of UI improvements and bugfixes, as well as a new configuration option for working with external OIDC providers.

Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/platform/releases/tag/v1.22.0).

### Features

#### Add optional jwks_uri configuration for OIDC issuers

The new optional `jwks_uri` field for the `TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_TRUSTED_AUDIENCES` configuration can be used to support for identity providers that don't publish discovery documents.

For example, when using Google IAP, a configuration value like this can be used:

```
{
    "issuer": "https://cloud.google.com/iap",
    "audiences": ["your-audience"],
    "jwks_uri": "https://www.gstatic.com/iap/verify/public_key-jwk"
}
```

### Bug Fixes

#### Editor Text Visibility Fixes

We fixed an issue where text near the bottom of the editor was sometimes hidden, making all content clearly visible again.

#### Fixed incorrect labels in the activity chart

We fixed an issue where some pipelines in the detailed activity chart were incorrectly labeled as “Ingress/Egress.” They now show the correct direction as “From node” or “To node.”
