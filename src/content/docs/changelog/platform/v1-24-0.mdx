This release includes many small UI fixes, as well as new TLS options for the websocket gateway.

Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/platform/releases/tag/v1.24.0).

### Features

#### Add option to require client certificates for the Tenzir Gateway

The Tenzir Gateway now understands the new `TENZIR_PLATFORM_REQUIRE_CLIENT_CERTS` environment
variable that, when set to true, requires connecting clients to present a valid certificate
signed by one of the CAs specified in `TLS_CAFILE`.

### Bug Fixes

#### Fixed total ingress/egress showing incorrect values after page reload

Previously, the total ingress and egress metrics could show incorrect values after reloading the page. They now correctly display data for the last 24 hours.
