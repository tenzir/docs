This release adds support for reading externally-supplied JWT tokens from a header, instead of manually clicking on the _Log In_ button.

Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/platform/releases/tag/v1.15.0).

### Features

#### Add support for login via externally-supplied JWTs

You can now configure the Tenzir Platform to accept externally-supplied JWTs, instead of
presenting a _Login_ button and performing the OIDC flow itself. This is done by setting
the `PRIVATE_JWT_FROM_HEADER` environment variable of the Tenzir UI service to the name
of a header containing the external JWT.

This is useful for situations where access to the Tenzir Platform is already protected by
an external authentication proxy that provides identity information to the application.
In this case, the provided information can now be used directly instead of going through
a second round of logins.

For example, to use this feature in combination with Google Cloud IAP, you would
set `PRIVATE_JWT_FROM_HEADER=X-Goog-IAP-JWT-Assertion` and set the trusted issuer in the
platform to `{"issuer":"https://cloud.google.com/iap","audiences":["<your_iap_audience>"]}`,
where the audience string depends on your IAP configuration but would typically look
like `"/projects/<project_number>/global/backendServices/<oauth_client_id>"`.

#### Add support for passing multiple issuer URLs

The Tenzir Platform can now accept JWTs from multiple independent issuers. This is useful in situations where the CLI and UI users are served by two different OIDC providers.

To configure multiple OIDC providers, set the `TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_TRUSTED_AUDIENCES` environment variable in your `.env` file to a list of issuer configurations:

```dotenv
TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_TRUSTED_AUDIENCES='[{"issuer": "https://accounts.google.com", "audiences": ["audience1"]}, {"issuer": "https://cloud.google.com/iap", "audiences": ["audience2", "audience3"]}]'
```

Note that the previous way of setting a single JSON object with `issuer` and `audiences` keys for this variable is still supported, so no change is required
if you only want to use a single issuer.

#### Persistent widget time range

The selected time range for the widgets now persists across page reloads and navigation, so you donâ€™t have to reselect it each time.

### Bug Fixes

#### Fix nodes not changing/disappearing after editing/deleting them

Fix an issue where the node wouldn't disappear from the list of nodes after
the node was deleted, or would update itself after being renamed, from the
dropdown menu (while the side bar was collapsed).
