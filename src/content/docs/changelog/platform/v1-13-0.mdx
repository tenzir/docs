This release contains improved integration for running the Tenzir Platform inside GCP, a new Schema Search functionality, and an option for showing the total diagnostic count in heatmap cells.

Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/platform/releases/tag/v1.13.0).

### Features

#### Option to allow passing extra headers to the API endpoint

The Tenzir Platform CLI now respects the `TENZIR_PLATFORM_CLI_EXTRA_HEADERS` environment variable
to add extra headers to any request made against the platform API. The value of this variable
must be set to a map of strings, eg.:

```
TENZIR_PLATFORM_CLI_EXTRA_HEADERS='{"Proxy-Authentication": "Bearer XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"}'
```

The schemas pane/ dropdown in the explorer page now has a search functionality.

#### Add support for Google OAuth clients to Platform CLI

The Tenzir Platform CLI now supports logging into internal Google OAuth clients created in GCP using the device code flow.

#### Add option for showing total diagnostics count in heatmap cells

Users can now switch between counting unique pipelines with diagnostics
(default) or total diagnostic message counts in heatmap cells. The new "Count
by" option is available in the time range dropdown of the diagnostics heatmap
in the pipelines tab of the nodes page.

#### Better error handling in the Tenzir Platform CLI

When encountering authentication errors, the Tenzir Platform CLI now exits with a nice error message instead of printing a raw stacktrace:

```sh
$ TENZIR_PLATFORM_CLI_ID_TOKEN=xxxx tenzir-platform workspace list
Error: Invalid JWT
  while validating TENZIR_PLATFORM_CLI_ID_TOKEN
(hint) upstream error: Not enough segments
```

### Changes

#### Update Tenzir Platform examples

We updated all examples in the Tenzir Platform repository to use the latest
best practices and to better integrate with the new docs page at https://docs.tenzir.com

We also removed the outdated `tenzir-developers` example, and added a new `native-tls` example instead
showing a complete setup with a private certificate authority.

Note that in order to get more consistent terminology in our examples, we updated the following
variable names. If you are planning to use an old `.env` file with the new platform version,
you will need to update these names as well.

The internal environment variables used by the individual docker services have not been changed,
so if you use your own `docker-compose.yaml` file updating the platform version is safe
without renaming these variables in your `.env` file.

```
TENZIR_PLATFORM_DOMAIN -> TENZIR_PLATFORM_UI_ENDPOINT
TENZIR_PLATFORM_CONTROL_ENDPOINT -> TENZIR_PLATFORM_NODES_ENDPOINT
TENZIR_PLATFORM_BLOBS_ENDPOINT -> TENZIR_PLATFORM_DOWNLOADS_ENDPOINT

TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_ADMIN_RULES -> TENZIR_PLATFORM_ADMIN_RULES
```

### Bug Fixes

#### Fix total activity change getting capped at 99.9

The percentage change in the ingress/egress widget was wrongly capped at 99.9 even when the actual value was much higher.

By [@dit7ya](https://github.com/dit7ya).

#### Fix pages reloading or resetting out of nowhere

We addressed a bug that caused many components in the app to reset or reload
whenever the user session was automatically extended in the background
(primarily affecting sovereign edition users with short session lifespans).
