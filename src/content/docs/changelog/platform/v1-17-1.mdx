### Changes

#### Allow renaming of nodes before connection

Previously, a node had to be connected before renaming was possible. You can now rename provisioned nodes even before they’re connected.

### Bug Fixes

#### Fixed 0s durations showing as empty

We fixed a formatting issue where exact 0s durations appeared as empty strings in the Inspector. These now display correctly.

#### Fixed selection in read-only pipeline code blocks

We fixed an issue where code in code blocks couldn’t be selected in package or configured pipelines. You can now easily copy specific parts of a pipeline.
