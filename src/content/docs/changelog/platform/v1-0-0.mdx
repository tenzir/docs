Tenzir Platform becomes generally available.

Since going live with app.tenzir.com last year, this release makes quite a few
changes. This release announces an all-new open source library for packages,
early availability of TQL2 (the next-generation language for pipelines), and a
complete redesign of app.tenzir.com, which now has a sleek, modern look.
