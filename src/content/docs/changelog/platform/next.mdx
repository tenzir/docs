Unreleased changes.

### Changes

#### Improved pipeline list activity metrics loading state

- The loading state for the sparkbars in the pipeline table no longer shows forever if none of the pipelines are running.
- The loading spinner for the sparkbars in the pipeline table has been replaced by a pulsating skeleton of the sparkbars, which is a little easier on the eyes.

#### Result controls moved to a floating bar

The result controls in the Explorer are now shown in a floating bar anchored at the bottom center of the page,
instead of above the results table, for easier access and a cleaner layout.

#### Schemas pane on the right

The schemas pane in the Explorer is now docked at the right edge consistently,
removing confusion between the icons for expanding schemas pane and the nodes
pane, and putting more attention on the results table.

#### Improvements to the Ingress/Egress data visualization

- The daily throughput widget now shows the number of bytes for the window that exactly matches the 24h range from the last seen data point, including smooth interpolation.
- The ingress/egress data shown now gets more realtime updates.
- The ingress/egress graph's X domain was made more stable, meaning there's no sudden jumps in the graph's X axis when new data is shown.

### Bug Fixes

#### Fix editor strip overlapping last lines

The editor’s control strip, which includes the Run button, no longer overlaps the last few lines of your code.
You can now see and work with your entire script without anything getting in the way.
