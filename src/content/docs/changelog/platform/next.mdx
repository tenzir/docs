Unreleased changes.

### Features

#### Added search to key dropdowns

You can now easily search and select items in key dropdowns such as the node selector, dashboard filters, and the workspace switcher, making it quicker to find what you need and reducing the effort of scrolling through long lists.

#### Copy token action for nodes

We added a "Copy token" option to the node selector’s actions menu, so you can quickly copy a Tenzir node’s token when needed.

### Changes

#### Improved page navigation layout

We refreshed the navigation experience in several areas. Tab bars in some places have been replaced with searchable dropdowns, and selectors like the node picker now show additional context such as version numbers. A new breadcrumb-style structure also makes navigation across pages more clear and visually streamlined.
