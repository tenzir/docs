### Bug Fixes

#### Fixed node selector resetting on navigation

The node selector now remembers your last selected node when navigating between pages. Previously, it would reset to the default node unexpectedly.

#### Fix hidden footer in package drawer

We fixed an issue where the footer in the pinned package drawer could become hidden. The layout now adjusts correctly so the install button always stays visible.
