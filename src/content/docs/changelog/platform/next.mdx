### Bug Fixes

#### Fixed internal server error when changing the default secret store

Fixed an issue that could cause the Tenzir Platform API to return a 500 internal server error for certain parameters.

#### Update the secret store CLI interface to align with the Platform API

The Tenzir Platform CLI was calling an outdated version of the secret store API, leading to unintended 404 errors. The CLI has been updated to use the latest version now.

#### Fix token generation for static workspaces

Fixed a bug that caused static workspace tokens to include stray  b'...' characters, resulting in invalid node tokens.
