### Changes

#### Improved pipeline list activity metrics loading state

- The loading state for the sparkbars in the pipeline table no longer shows forever if none of the pipelines are running.
- The loading spinner for the sparkbars in the pipeline table has been replaced by a pulsating skeleton of the sparkbars, which is a little easier on the eyes.

#### Improvements to the Ingress/Egress data visualization

- The daily throughput widget now shows the number of bytes for the window that exactly matches the 24h range from the last seen data point, including smooth interpolation.
- The ingress/egress data shown now gets more realtime updates.
- The ingress/egress graph's X domain was made more stable, meaning there's no sudden jumps in the graph's X axis when new data is shown.

### Bug Fixes

#### Fix editor strip overlapping last lines

The editorâ€™s control strip, which includes the Run button, no longer overlaps the last few lines of your code.
You can now see and work with your entire script without anything getting in the way.
