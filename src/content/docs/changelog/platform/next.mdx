Unreleased changes.

### Features

#### Partial pipeline execution

You can now run a selected portion of the pipeline by highlighting it with your mouse or keyboard. When a selection is active,
the **Run** button changes to **Run selected**, allowing you to execute just the highlighted section for quicker iteration and testing.

### Changes

Diagnostics listed next to the editor are now sorted chronologically, making it easier to follow the order in which issues occur.
