#### Add option for showing total diagnostics count in heatmap cells

Users can now switch between counting unique pipelines with diagnostics
(default) or total diagnostic message counts in heatmap cells. The new "Count
by" option is available in the time range dropdown of the diagnostics heatmap
in the pipelines tab of the nodes page.

### Changes

#### Update Tenzir Platform examples

We updated all examples in the Tenzir Platform repository to use the latest
best practices and to better integrate with the new docs page at https://docs.tenzir.com

We also removed the outdated `tenzir-developers` example, and added a new `native-tls` example instead
showing a complete setup with a private certificate authority.

Note that in order to get more consistent terminology in our examples, we updated the following
variable names. If you are planning to use an old `.env` file with the new platform version,
you will need to update these names as well.

The internal environment variables used by the individual docker services have not been changed,
so if you use your own `docker-compose.yaml` file updating the platform version is safe
without renaming these variables in your `.env` file.

```
TENZIR_PLATFORM_DOMAIN -> TENZIR_PLATFORM_UI_ENDPOINT
TENZIR_PLATFORM_CONTROL_ENDPOINT -> TENZIR_PLATFORM_NODES_ENDPOINT
TENZIR_PLATFORM_BLOBS_ENDPOINT -> TENZIR_PLATFORM_DOWNLOADS_ENDPOINT

TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_ADMIN_RULES -> TENZIR_PLATFORM_ADMIN_RULES
```

#### Fix total activity change getting capped at 99.9

The percentage change in the ingress/egress widget was wrongly capped at 99.9 even when the actual value was much higher.
