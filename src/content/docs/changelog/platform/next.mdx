### Features

#### A new way to view pipeline diagnostics

You can now view the exact diagnostics that occurred during a window of time by clicking on the corresponding cell in the heatmap.

This opens up a new panel below the heatmap where diagnostics are shown grouped by pipeline. From here, it's also possible to search for diagnostics by text.
