Unreleased changes.

We added a new CloudFormation template for Sovereign Edition customers who are interested in quickly setting up a fully AWS-native platform instance.

### Changes

#### Library experience enhanced with faster loading

We made browsing the library much smoother. Package details now load faster, the app prefetches data in the background to reduce wait times, and you can manually refresh to get the latest information anytime.
