#### Fix some issues with the seaweed container

#### Type Icons in the Explorer

We replaced text labels with icons for types in the Explorer table header, giving it a cleaner, more compact look. You can hover over any icon to see the full type name.

### Changes

#### Switch default user for seaweed container

To conform with best practices, we updated the `tenzir-seaweed` image to use a non-root user by default.

**NOTE**: This is a breaking change due to the updated permissions of the seaweed data volume.
If you have an existing docker compose stack, either manually specify the root user in your `docker-compose.yaml`:

```yaml
services:
  seaweed:
    user: root
```

Or run a one-time command after upgrading to change the permissions of the seaweed data volume:

```sh
docker compose run --user root --entrypoint /bin/sh seaweed
$ chown -R seaweed:seaweed /var/lib/seaweedfs
```
