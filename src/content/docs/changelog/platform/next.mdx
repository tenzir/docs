### Bug Fixes

#### Editor Text Visibility Fixes

We fixed an issue where text near the bottom of the editor was sometimes hidden, making all content clearly visible again.

#### Fixed incorrect labels in the activity chart

We fixed an issue where some pipelines in the detailed activity chart were incorrectly labeled as “Ingress/Egress.” They now show the correct direction as “From node” or “To node.”
