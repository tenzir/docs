Unreleased changes.

### Features

#### A new way to view pipeline diagnostics

You can now view the exact diagnostics that occurred during a window of time by clicking on the corresponding cell in the heatmap.

This opens up a new panel below the heatmap where diagnostics are shown grouped by pipeline. From here, it's also possible to search for diagnostics by text.

### Changes

#### Removed TQL2 switch from editor

With the minimum required node version now at 5.0.0, the editor no longer shows the TQL2 switch. You can now run TQL2 pipelines natively without needing to toggle anything.
