### Changes

#### Print better error message for audience mismatch

The error message emitted by the platform on an audience mismatch in a supplied JWT now mentions the expected and provided audiences. (unless the provided audience contains non-url-safe characters)

#### Custom OIDC sign-in request params

You can now use the environment variable `EXTRA_OIDC_REQUEST_PARAMS` to set custom query parameters with the sign-in requests that get sent to the OIDC provider. This is useful for configuring the endpoint's behavior through provider specific options.
