Unreleased changes.

### Features

#### A new way to view pipeline diagnostics

You can now view the exact diagnostics that occurred during a window of time by clicking on the corresponding cell in the heatmap.

This opens up a new panel below the heatmap where diagnostics are shown grouped by pipeline. From here, it's also possible to search for diagnostics by text.

#### Diagnostics in the editor

Diagnostics are now shown directly in the editor, with the associated code
snippet being highlighted. Users can hover over the code to see detailed error
and warning information in a floating popup. Additionally, the diagnostics pane
opener button has been moved to the editor's results strip for improved accessibility.

### Changes

#### Removed TQL2 switch from editor

With the minimum required node version now at 5.0.0, the editor no longer shows the TQL2 switch. You can now run TQL2 pipelines natively without needing to toggle anything.
