### Features

#### Add support for login via externally-supplied JWTs

You can now configure the Tenzir Platform to accept externally-supplied JWTs, instead of
presenting a _Login_ button and performing the OIDC flow itself. This is done by setting
the `PRIVATE_JWT_FROM_HEADER` environment variable of the Tenzir UI service to the name
of a header containing the external JWT.

This is useful for situations where access to the Tenzir Platform is already protected by
an external authentication proxy that provides identity information to the application.
In this case, the provided information can now be used directly instead of going through
a second round of logins.

For example, to use this feature in combination with Google Cloud IAP, you would
set `PRIVATE_JWT_FROM_HEADER=X-Goog-IAP-JWT-Assertion` and set the trusted issuer in the
platform to `{"issuer":"https://cloud.google.com/iap","audiences":["<your_iap_audience>"]}`,
where the audience string depends on your IAP configuration but would typically look
like `"/projects/<project_number>/global/backendServices/<oauth_client_id>"`.
