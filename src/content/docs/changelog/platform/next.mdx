Unreleased changes.

### Features

#### Three-dot menu for pipeline items

You can now quickly start, stop, copy the ID, or delete a pipeline right from the pipelines table.
Just click the three-dot menu at the far right of any pipeline row. It's a simple way to manage one pipeline at a time,
without needing to open the bulk actions menu.

#### Partial pipeline execution

You can now run a selected portion of the pipeline by highlighting it with your mouse or keyboard. When a selection is active,
the **Run** button changes to **Run selected**, allowing you to execute just the highlighted section for quicker iteration and testing.

### Changes

#### Chronological diagnostics sorting in the explorer

Diagnostics listed next to the editor are now sorted chronologically, making it easier to follow the order in which issues occur.
