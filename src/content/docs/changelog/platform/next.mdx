Unreleased changes.

### Features

#### Pipeline detail page

Pipelines now have their own dedicated detail pages that you can access by
clicking on any pipeline name. This gives you a comprehensive view of your
pipeline in a full-screen interface designed for deep inspection and
configuration.

### Changes

#### Show current and latest versions in node update info

We now show both the current version and the latest available version when an update is available or required. For example, in the node selector you see your current version alongside the latest release version.
