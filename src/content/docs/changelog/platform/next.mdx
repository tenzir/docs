### Changes

#### Consistent blob rendering

We now render blobs consistently in the inspector and the table. The inspector shows blob literals using the `b"..."` notation, making it easier to work with them.

### Bug Fixes

#### Fixed history position when rerunning pipelines

#### Big numbers in objects and lists

Big numbers (those exceeding `9007199254740991`) in records and lists no longer
cause the data table to fail rendering.
