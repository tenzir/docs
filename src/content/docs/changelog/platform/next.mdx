Unreleased changes.

### Features

#### Three-dot menu for pipeline items

You can now quickly start, stop, copy the ID, or delete a pipeline right from the pipelines table.
Just click the three-dot menu at the far right of any pipeline row. It's a simple way to manage one pipeline at a time,
without needing to open the bulk actions menu.

#### Partial pipeline execution

You can now run a selected portion of the pipeline by highlighting it with your mouse or keyboard. When a selection is active,
the **Run** button changes to **Run selected**, allowing you to execute just the highlighted section for quicker iteration and testing.

#### Secret data type display

Secret data types now display as `<secret>` in the platform, for example,
in the explorer table. A tooltip explains that secret values are not transported
to the platform for security reasons.

In TQL exports (such as copy to clipboard), secrets are copied as `null`.

### Changes

#### Make the list of nodes reload more often again

We recently raised the refresh time on the list of nodes to 30 seconds.
After your feedback, it became apparent that we should have kept it as it was.

#### Chronological diagnostics sorting in the explorer

Diagnostics listed next to the editor are now sorted chronologically, making it easier to follow the order in which issues occur.

### Bug Fixes

#### Fix false 'deployed pipeline failed' toasts

We no longer show 'deployed pipeline failed' toasts for pipelines that
weren't actually deployed, but were running via the Explorer,
Dashboard, or other sources like that.

#### Fix 'View'-button in failed pipeline Toast

When a deployed pipeline fails, a "Toast" popup is shown in the bottom right that allows you to view the error, except, that button didn't work. Now it does!

And while we were at it, we also improved the text for these toasts a little to make it clearer that it's specifically about a *deployed* pipeline.
