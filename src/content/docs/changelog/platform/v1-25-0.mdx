This release includes some UI fixes and minor improvements to smooth out common workflows. We fixed incorrect rendering of negative durations, resolved an issue where the node selector reset during navigation, and addressed a layout issue that could hide the install button in the package drawer.

Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/platform/releases/tag/v1.25.0).

### Bug Fixes

#### Fixed incorrect rendering of negative durations

We fixed an issue where negative durations did not display correctly in the app. They now render as expected.

#### Fixed node selector resetting on navigation

The node selector now remembers your last selected node when navigating between pages. Previously, it would reset to the default node unexpectedly.

#### Fix hidden footer in package drawer

We fixed an issue where the footer in the pinned package drawer could become hidden. The layout now adjusts correctly so the install button always stays visible.
