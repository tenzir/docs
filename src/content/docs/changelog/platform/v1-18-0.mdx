With this release of the Tenzir Platform, we reorganized the UI to make the most important pages more accessible.

Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/platform/releases/tag/v1.18.0).

### Features

#### Allow custom OIDC scope and audience params

Added support for customizing OIDC scope and audience parameters in the CLI to provide more flexibility in authentication configuration.

#### Added search to key dropdowns

You can now easily search and select items in key dropdowns such as the node selector, dashboard filters, and the workspace switcher, making it quicker to find what you need and reducing the effort of scrolling through long lists.

#### Live activity redesign with Sparklines

The platform now shows activity for deployed piplines with sparklines (instead of sparkbars).

The data behind the sparkline is also improved and more accurate now.

#### Copy token action for nodes

We added a "Copy token" option to the node selector’s actions menu, so you can quickly copy a Tenzir node’s token when needed.

### Changes

#### Reorganized navigation for easier access

We reorganized the navigation to make it easier to use. The Nodes menu item is now replaced by dedicated items for Pipelines, Explorer, Contexts, and Library. The Packages tab has also moved into the Library, where you can select it from the dropdown.

### Bug Fixes

#### Fixed performance issue in charts

We resolved an issue that could cause the app to use more memory than necessary when displaying charts.
