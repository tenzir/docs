This release fixes two issues in the Tenzir UI that were found since the last release.

Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/platform/releases/tag/v1.16.1).

### Bug Fixes

#### Fix unscrollable pipelines table

We fixed a bug that prevented the pipelines table from scrolling to the bottom, which caused some pipelines to be hidden and inaccessible.

#### Fixed stray line in widget axis

We fixed a visual bug where a thin white line appeared above the “Egress” label in the first widget on the Nodes page due to an empty axis label.
