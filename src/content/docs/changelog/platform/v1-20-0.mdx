This release introduces keyboard shortcut indicators for buttons, ensures consistent blob rendering, shows UDOs in the package info, and includes fixes for big number rendering and history position.

Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/platform/releases/tag/v1.20.0).

### Features

#### UDOs visible in package info

User-defined operators (UDOs) included in a library package now appear in the packageâ€™s About section, so you can easily see which UDOs the package contains.

#### Added keyboard shortcut indicators

We added visual indicators for keyboard shortcuts to all buttons in modals and other places that support them, making it easier to discover and use shortcuts.

### Changes

#### Consistent blob rendering

We now render blobs consistently in the inspector and the table. The inspector shows blob literals using the `b"..."` notation, making it easier to work with them.

### Bug Fixes

#### Fixed history position when rerunning pipelines

We fixed an issue where running a pipeline from your history did not reset your position to the newest entry. Your view now updates correctly.

#### Big numbers in objects and lists

Big numbers (those exceeding `9007199254740991`) in records and lists no longer
cause the data table to fail rendering.
