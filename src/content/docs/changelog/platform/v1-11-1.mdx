#### Pipeline page widgets

**Introduction**

The pipeline page now features four widgets placed above the table of pipelines. These widgets provide information about pipelines shown below, as well as allow you to further filter down the list of pipelines.

**The Status Widget**

The first widget, placed in the top left of the screen, shows the total number of pipelines found after search and filtering. It also shows a breakdown of how many pipelines exist for each of 4 statuses:

- `Running`,
- `Completed`,
- `Failed` or
- `Stopped`.

Clicking on one of these status buttons will filter to pipelines with that particular status. Holding the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key while clicking will add the selected status to your current filter instead of replacing it.

The status widget replaces the pipeline state filtering feature found in the pipelines table header, which has now been removed.

**The Daily Ingress/Egress Widget**

Just below the Status Widget is a widget that shows the total ingress and egress traffic for all pipelines after search and filtering, and the percentage difference between the two.

**The Ingress/Egress Chart Widget**

To the right of the other two widgets, the Ingress/Egress Chart shows a graph of all combined ingress and egress for the pipelines after searching and filtering. It supports a few different periods which can be selected from a drop-down.

**The Diagnostics Widget**

On the rightmost side of the widgets row you'll find a heatmap visualizing how many pipelines experienced warnings or errors, with four-hour cells. Searching or otherwise filtering the list of pipelines will update this widget to reflect the new set of pipelines.

Clicking on a cell will filter the list of pipelines to contain only those pipelines that encountered warnings or errors during the corresponding time period. Clicking again will remove the filter.

The time range selected for the diagnostics is also used for the diagnostics column in the pipeline list below.

### Changes

#### Removal of pipeline pausing

Pipeline pausing is a rarely used feature, and its support will soon be removed from nodes, so we've updated the UI, and no longer show the pause buttons in the pipeline detail page, and the multi-select pipeline actions.

If a pipeline is already paused, it can still be found in the pipeline list, and is categorized by the status widget as a "stopped" pipeline.

#### Removal of pipeline labels

Labels are a feature that has long been scheduled for removal, and the rework of the pipelines page that comes with this release was a good opportunity to do so.

By [@avaq](https://github.com/avaq), [@dit7ya](https://github.com/dit7ya).

#### Node ID and tab in the URL

The selected node, and the tab you're viewing, are now part of the page URL, which has the following consequences:

1. You should now stay where you were when reloading the page
2. Copying links, bookmarking, etc. is now possible.
3. Some links into the app might have broken, but most will redirect to the right place.
4. Previously created pipeline share URLs will not work anymore.

By [@avaq](https://github.com/avaq).

#### Lower wait times when data loading fails

When there's an error that prevents the app from being able to load data, the app would previously keep trying for 30 seconds while showing a loading spinner. This has been reduced to 5 seconds so that in case of a problem, the UI will display the error sooner.

By [@avaq](https://github.com/avaq).

#### Improved page titles

The page you're on in the app is now shown in the tab title, making it easier to find the right tab when working with multiple tabs, and making it easier to find things in the browser history.

#### Optimized pipeline listing

On the pipelines page, the list of pipelines is now more realtime while using less network traffic.

By [@avaq](https://github.com/avaq).

#### Move pipeline actions into table header

We have moved the pipeline actions (start/ stop/ delete) into a floating action bar to the bottom.
The table layout has also slightly changed - to select pipelines (for actions), click on the toggle button in the header.

### Bug Fixes

#### Fixed version identifier in Sovereign Edition

The Sovereign Edition of the Tenzir Platform now correctly prints its current Git commit hash in the browser console upon loading.

#### Fix glitch when saving a pipeline

Fixed an issue where when updating a pipeline via the pipeline detail pane, the "Restart on error" checkbox would briefly reset to its previous state before switching to the correct one.

By [@avaq](https://github.com/avaq).

#### Fix navigation sometimes being non-responsive

We resolved an issue where ocasionally and seemingly at random, when clicking any button in the app that would lead to another page, nothing would happen, and you'd have to click again.
