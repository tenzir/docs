This release adds CLI support for adding, removing and updating secrets.  It also adds a new three-dot menu on the pipelines page, as well as partial pipeline execution from the history.

Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/platform/releases/tag/v1.14.0).

### Features

#### Three-dot menu for pipeline items

You can now quickly start, stop, copy the ID, or delete a pipeline right from the pipelines table.
Just click the three-dot menu at the far right of any pipeline row. It's a simple way to manage one pipeline at a time,
without needing to open the bulk actions menu.

#### Add secrets support for the Platform

With this release, the Tenzir Platform now supports storing secrets on a per-workspace level.

In the Tenzir UI, you can click on the new gears icon in the workspace switcher to get to the Workspace settings, where you can add, modify or delete secrets for you workspace.

In the Tenzir CLI, you can use the new `tenzir-platform secret` subcommand for the same purpose:

```plain
tenzir-platform secret add <name> [--file=<file>] [--value=<value>] [--env]
tenzir-platform secret update <secret> [--file=<file>] [--value=<value>] [--env]
tenzir-platform secret delete <secret>
tenzir-platform secret list [--json]
```

#### Support using different blob storage URLs for UI and Nodes

The Tenzir Platform now supports the `BLOB_STORAGE__NODES_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT_URL` environment variable that allows overriding the URL used by the nodes to reach the configured S3-compatible blob storage.
This is useful if the Tenzir Nodes run in a separate network from the Tenzir UI, and the blob storage is exposed under different domains in both networks.

#### Partial pipeline execution

You can now run a selected portion of the pipeline by highlighting it with your mouse or keyboard. When a selection is active,
the **Run** button changes to **Run selected**, allowing you to execute just the highlighted section for quicker iteration and testing.

#### Secret data type display

Secret data types now display as `<secret>` in the platform, for example,
in the explorer table. A tooltip explains that secret values are not transported
to the platform for security reasons.

In TQL exports (such as copy to clipboard), secrets are copied as `null`.

### Changes

#### Make the list of nodes reload more often again

We recently raised the refresh time on the list of nodes to 30 seconds.
After your feedback, it became apparent that we should have kept it as it was.

#### Better error messages for HTTP errors

The Tenzir Platform CLI now prints better error messages for HTTP errors encountered when communicating with the Tenzir Platform, including the contents of the `detail` field if provided.

#### Chronological diagnostics sorting in the explorer

Diagnostics listed next to the editor are now sorted chronologically, making it easier to follow the order in which issues occur.

### Bug Fixes

#### Fix false 'deployed pipeline failed' toasts

We no longer show 'deployed pipeline failed' toasts for pipelines that
weren't actually deployed, but were running via the Explorer,
Dashboard, or other sources like that.

#### Fix 'View'-button in failed pipeline Toast

When a deployed pipeline fails, a "Toast" popup is shown in the bottom right that allows you to view the error, except, that button didn't work. Now it does!

And while we were at it, we also improved the text for these toasts a little to make it clearer that it's specifically about a *deployed* pipeline.

#### Correctly set workspace category when creating new workspaces

The Tenzir Platform CLI now correctly sets the workspace category when creating a new workspace.
