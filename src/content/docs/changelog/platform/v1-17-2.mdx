You can now select parts of a pipeline from the history pane without closing it and the bottom bar in charts does not overlap with the contant any more.

Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/platform/releases/tag/v1.17.2).

### Bug Fixes

#### Fixed history item clicks blocking text selection

Clicking a history item no longer adds its pipeline to the editor. That action now appears as a button in the floating controls on each item, so you can freely select and copy text without accidentally modifying the editor or closing the history pane.

#### Added bottom margin to charts

We added extra space below charts to prevent them from overlapping with the floating controls bar in the Explorer.
