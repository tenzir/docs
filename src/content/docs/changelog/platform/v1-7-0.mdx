This release introduces a new Drag'n'Drop feature to easily work with data
from local files, and adds additional configuration knobs for Sovereign
Edition users.

Sovereign Edition users get a few more options to customize their deployment:
* `ANALYTICS_WEBHOOK_URL`: Allows configuring an analytics sink for sending
  events
* `TLS_KEYFILE`/`TLS_CERTFILE`: Allow the platform and websocket gateway
  services to provide native TLS support, when not running behind a reverse
  proxy
