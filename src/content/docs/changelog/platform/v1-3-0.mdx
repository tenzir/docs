This release introduces a new **vertical layout** option to make better use of
the screen space available for event data and longer pipelines:

This release also contains many additional improvements and bugfixes:
* The explorer event inspector now automatically selects the first event if it
  is open.
* This release fixes an issue in the detailed activity charts in the pipelines
  page where the ingress and egress activities are mistakenly swapped.
* Charts in the dashboard show up to 10,000 events now.
