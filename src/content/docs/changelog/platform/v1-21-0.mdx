This release improves how you browse, edit, and share pipelines. We fixed overlapping timestamps in the activity chart, made pipeline updates more reliable and visible, sped up library loading, and added a new button in the editor to copy a link to the current pipeline.

Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/platform/releases/tag/v1.21.0).

### Features

#### Copy pipeline link from editor

We added a new button next to the Examples button in the editor that lets you copy a link to the current pipeline, just like in the history pane.

We added a new CloudFormation template for Sovereign Edition customers who are interested in quickly setting up a fully AWS-native platform instance.

### Changes

#### Library experience enhanced with faster loading

We made browsing the library much smoother. Package details now load faster, the app prefetches data in the background to reduce wait times, and you can manually refresh to get the latest information anytime.

### Bug Fixes

#### Fixed overlapping timestamps in activity chart

We fixed an issue where timestamps overlapped on the x-axis of the detailed activity chart on some widths, making them hard to read.

#### Improved pipeline updates and diagnostics visibility

We fixed issues that caused pipeline updates to sometimes fail or not show clearly. Diagnostics now appear directly in the editor instead of under the chart, making them easier to spot while editing.
