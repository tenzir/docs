This bugfix release fixes an issue where the Tenzir Platform would generate download URLs with an incorrect signature.

Download the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/platform/releases/tag/v1.17.3).

### Bug Fixes

#### Fix download links for Sovereign Edition platform

We switched to use the AWS v4 signature algorithm for generating presigned URLs,
rather than the deprecated v2 version. This fixes an incompatibility between
recent versions of boto3 and seaweedfs.
