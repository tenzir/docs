title: Windows Event Logs
---

Windows Event Logs are records generated by the Windows operating system and applications that detail system, security, and application-related events for monitoring and troubleshooting purposes.

Once Windows Event Logs are flowing in a Tenzir pipeline, you can use any
operator to process them. The below examples simply [import all data into a
node](/guides/edge-storage/import-into-a-node).

## Collect logs with an agent

Installing a third-party agent to ship logs away from a Windows machine is
common way to send events to a remote location.

![Windows Events with Agent](windows-event-logs/windows-events-with-agent.svg)

Regardless of the concrete agent you are using for shipping, the high-level
setup is always the same: the agent sends events in a push-based to a Tenzir
pipeline.

### Winlogbeat

[Winlogbeat](https://www.elastic.co/beats/winlogbeat) is Elastic's log shipper
to get Windows Event Logs out of Windows machines into the Elastic stack.

#### Configure Winlogbeat

After [installing
Winlogbeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/winlogbeat/current/winlogbeat-installation-configuration.html),
create a configuration:

```yaml title="winlogbeat.yml"
# Choose your channels.
winlogbeat.event_logs:
  - name: Application
  - name: System
  - name: Security
  - name: ForwardedEvents
  - name: Windows PowerShell
  - name: Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational
  - name: Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational
  - name: Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational
  - name: Microsoft-Windows-TaskScheduler/Operational
  - name: Microsoft-Windows-TerminalServices-LocalSessionManager/Operational
  - name: Microsoft-Windows-TerminalServices-RDPClient/Operational

# Send data to a Tenzir pipeline with an ElasticSearch source.
output.elasticsearch:
  hosts: ["https://10.0.0.1:9200"]
  username: "$USER"
  password: "$PASSWORD"
  ssl:
    enabled: true
    certificate_authorities: [C:\Program Files\Winlogbeat\ca.crt]
    # PEM format
    certificate: C:\Program Files\Winlogbeat\tenzir.crt
    key: C:\Program Files\Winlogbeat\beat-win10\tenzir.key
```

#### Start Winlogbeat as a service

After completing your configuration, start the Winlogbeat service:

```
C:\Program Files\Winlogbeat> Start-Service winlogbeat
```

#### Run a Tenzir pipeline

Now consume the data via a Tenzir pipeline using the
[Elasticsearch](/integrations/elasticsearch)/[OpenSearch](/integrations/opensearch) integration
that mimics a bulk ingest endpoint:

```tql
from "elasticsearch://10.0.0.1:92000" \
  tls=true,
  certfile="server.crt",
  keyfile="private.key"
import
```

### Fluent Bit

Since Tenzir has native Fluent Bit support, collecting logs via the Fluent Bit
agent is a simple approach.

#### Configure Fluent Bit

First, install Fluent Bit on Windows according to the [official
instructions](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/installation/windows).

Then create a [YAML
configuration](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/administration/configuring-fluent-bit/yaml/configuration-file)
to send Windows Event Logs out via the [Forward
output](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/outputs/forward), which
encodes the events using Fluent Bit's MsgPack-based wire format:

```yaml
input:
  - name: winevtlog
    channels: Setup,Windows PowerShell
    interval_sec: 1
    db: winevtlog.sqlite
output:
  - name: forward
    match: "*"
    host: 10.0.0.1
```

Adapt `input.channels` according to the Event Log channels you would like Fluent
Bit to monitor.

#### Run a Tenzir pipeline

Use the [`from_fluent_bit`](/reference/operators/from_fluent_bit) source
operator with the [Forward
input](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/inputs/forward):

```tql
from_fluent_bit "forward", options={
  listen: 10.0.0.1,
}
import
```

Ensure that the `listen` parameter matches the `host` value in your Fluent Bit
configuration.

#### Test the configuration

Test the setup by running the Fluent Bit command line utility:

```
C:\Program Files\fluent-bit\bin\fluent-bit.exe -c \fluent-bit\conf\fluent-bit.yaml
```

#### Deploy Fluent Bit as a service

To make the setup permanent, [run Fluent Bit as a
service](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/installation/windows#windows-service-support).

Create the service:

```
sc.exe create fluent-bit binpath= "\fluent-bit\bin\fluent-bit.exe -c \fluent-bit\conf\fluent-bit.yaml"
```

Start and check the service:

```
sc.exe start fluent-bit
sc.exe query fluent-bit
```

Start the service at boot:

```
sc.exe config fluent-bit start= auto
```

### NXLog

The NXLog agent collects Windows Event Logs and offers numerous [output
modules](https://docs.nxlog.co/refman/current/om/index.html). You have several
options with Tenzir. We use the JSON extension to format the data in all
examples.

#### Ship logs via TCP

To send logs straight to a TCP socket, use the [TCP output
module](https://docs.nxlog.co/refman/current/om/tcp.html) with the following
configuration:

```
<Extension json>
  Module    xm_json
</Extension>

<Output tcp>
  Module    om_tcp
  Host      10.0.0.1:1514
  Exec      to_json();
</Output>
```

Import the logs via TCP:

```tql
from "tcp://10.0.0.1:1514" {
  read_json
}
import
```

#### Ship logs via TLS/SSL

For an encrypted connection, use the [SSL output
module](https://docs.nxlog.co/refman/current/om/ssl.html) with the following
configuration:

```
<Extension json>
  Module          xm_json
</Extension>

<Output ssl>
  Module          om_ssl
  Host            example.com:23456
  CAFile          %CERTDIR%/ca.pem
  CertFile        %CERTDIR%/client-cert.pem
  CertKeyFile     %CERTDIR%/client-key.pem
  KeyPass         secret
  AllowUntrusted  TRUE
  OutputType      Binary
  Exec            to_json();
</Output>
```

Import the logs via TCP:

```tql
load_tcp "127.0.0.1:4000",
  tls=true,
  certfile="key_and_cert.pem",
  keyfile="key_and_cert.pem" {
    read_json
  }
import
```

#### Ship logs via Kafka

The [Kafka output module](https://docs.nxlog.co/refman/current/om/kafka.html)
publishes to a Kafka topic that Tenzir can read from. Use the following output
configuration to publish to the `nxlog` topic:

```
<Output out>
  Module          om_kafka
  BrokerList      localhost:9092
  Topic           nxlog
  LogqueueSize    100000
  Partition       0
  Protocol        ssl
  CAFile          %CERTDIR%/ca.pem
  CertFile        %CERTDIR%/client-cert.pem
  CertKeyFile     %CERTDIR%/client-key.pem
  KeyPass         thisisasecret
</Output>
```

Then use our [Kafka integration](/integrations/kafka) to read from the topic:

```tql
from "kafka://nxlog" {
  read_json
}
import
```

## Collect logs via WEF & WEC

Instead of deploying an agent on a Windows endpoint, you can also use native
facilities to collect logs centrally.

To this end, Windows comes with a **Windows Event Forwarding (WEF)** mechanism on
the endpoints that uses standard _Windows Remote Management (WinRM)_ protocols
to transmit events. The **Windows Event Collector (WEC)** is the service running
on a server that receives the events sent by clients through WEF. The WEC
aggregates these logs and makes them available for review and analysis.
Administrators can create subscriptions on the WEC that define which events to
collect from which clients, using criteria such as event IDs, keywords, or log
levels.

The diagram below illustrates a typical setup:

![WEF & WEC](windows-event-logs/windows-events-wef-wec.svg)

On the WEC, you typically ship the collected logs away using a third-party
agent, as described above. Read below on using
[OpenWEC](#collect-logs-via-openwec) as an agent-free alternative.

The following configuration steps are heavily inspired by
[SEKOIA](https://docs.sekoia.io/xdr/features/collect/integrations/endpoint/windows/#windows-event-forwarder-to-windows-event-collector-to-a-concentrator)'s
instructions.

### Setup the Window Event Collector (WEC)

We begin with setting up the WEC prior to connecting the client to it.

#### Setup Windows Remote Management (WinRM)

Configure WinRM as follows:

```cmd
winrm qc -q
```

The argument `qc` stands for "quick configuration" to perform a basic
configuration of WinRM with default settings. This configuration includes
starting the WinRM service, setting it to start automatically with the system,
creating a listener on HTTP to accept WS-Management protocol requests, and
configuring the Windows Firewall to allow WinRM traffic.

The `-q` flag means "quiet mode" to avoid prompting you for any input or
confirmation, i.e., it makes the process non-interactive.

:::caution Unencrypted HTTP
This command sets up WinRM to listen on HTTP, which is not encrypted. For a
secure production environment, it's advisable to configure WinRM to use HTTPS,
which requires additional steps, including setting up an appropriate server
certificate for encryption.
:::

#### Enable the Event Collector service

Use the `wecutil` command to perform the necessary steps to set up the Windows
Event Collector service:

```cmd
wecutil qc /q
```

As above, `qc` stands for "quick configuration" and `/q` for "quiet". The setup
includes actions such as configuring the service to start automatically and
ensuring that the service is in a state ready to create and manage event
subscriptions.

#### Create a subscription file

Create a new file with the following contents:

```xml title="DC_SUBSCRIPTION.xml"
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Subscription xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2006/03/windows/events/subscription">
    <!-- Name of subscription -->
    <SubscriptionId>DC_SUBSCRIPTION</SubscriptionId>
    <!-- Push mode (DC to WEC) -->
    <SubscriptionType>SourceInitiated</SubscriptionType>
    <Description>Source Initiated Subscription from DC_SUBSCRIPTION</Description>
    <!-- Subscription is active -->
    <Enabled>true</Enabled>
    <Uri>http://schemas.microsoft.com/wbem/wsman/1/windows/EventLog</Uri>
    <!-- This mode ensures that events are delivered with minimal delay -->
    <!-- It is an appropriate choice if you are collecting alerts or critical events -->
    <!-- It uses push delivery mode and sets a batch timeout of 30 seconds -->
    <ConfigurationMode>MinLatency</ConfigurationMode>
    <!-- Event log to retrieved -->
    <Query>
        <![CDATA[
            <QueryList>
                <Query Id="0">
                    <Select Path="Application">*</Select>
                    <Select Path="Security">*</Select>
                    <Select Path="System">*</Select>
                </Query>
            </QueryList>
        ]]>
    </Query>
    <!-- Collect events generated since the subscription (not oldest) -->
    <ReadExistingEvents>false</ReadExistingEvents>
    <!-- Protocol and port used (DC to WEC) -->
    <TransportName>http</TransportName>
    <!-- Mandatory value (https://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?crawler=1&uid=swg1IV71375) -->
    <ContentFormat>RenderedText</ContentFormat>
    <Locale Language="en-US"/>
    <!-- Target Event log on WEC -->
    <LogFile>ForwardedEvents</LogFile>
    <!-- Define which domain computers are allowed or not to initiate subscriptions -->
    <!-- This exemple grants members of the Domain Computers domain group, as well as the local Network Service group (for local forwarder) -->
    <AllowedSourceDomainComputers>O:NSG:NSD:(A;;GA;;;DC)(A;;GA;;;NS)</AllowedSourceDomainComputers>
</Subscription>
```

Key elements are:

- `SubscriptionId`: Give a unique name to your subscription.
- `SubscriptionType`: Choose between `SourceInitiated` (push) or `CollectorInitiated` (pull).
- `Description`: Provide a meaningful description.
- `Query`: Modify the event log query to specify which events to collect.
- `LogFile`: Define the destination log file on the collector.
- `AllowedSourceDomainComputers`: Adjust the [SDDL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/win32/secauthz/security-descriptor-definition-language?redirectedfrom=MSDN) string to specify which computers can forward events.

There are [several](https://github.com/palantir/windows-event-forwarding/tree/master/wef-subscriptions) [GitHub](https://github.com/nsacyber/Event-Forwarding-Guidance/tree/master/Subscriptions/samples) [repositories](https://github.com/mdecrevoisier/Windows-WEC-server_auto-deploy/tree/master/windows-subscriptions) out there with ideas for additional subscriptions.

#### Activate the subscription

Now that the collector is running, activate the subscription:

```cmd
wecutil cs "<FILE_PATH>\DC_SUBSCRIPTION.xml"
```

The `cs` subcommand stands for "create subscription" and creates a subscription
according to the file passed as the next argument.

#### Verify the subscription

Finally, verify that the subscription is active:

```cmd
wecutil gr DC_SUBSCRIPTION
```

The `gr` subcommand stands for "get runtime status" and displays the
subscription status for the ID `DC_SUBSCRIPTION`, which corresponds to the
`<SubscriptionId>` XML tag in the configuration file.

### Setup Windows Event Forwarding (WEF)

After you completed the server-side configuration, now configure the machines
that should log to the WEC.

#### Setup Windows Remote Management (WinRM)

Active WinRM as follows:

```cmd
winrm qc -q \
```

This step is identical to the WinRM configuration on the WEC.

#### Change local group policy settings

Use the Local Group Policy Editor (`gpedit.msc`) to navigate to the `Computer
Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Event Forwarding`
path. Here, you'll need to open the policy named "Configure the server address,
refresh interval, and issuer certificate authority of a target Subscription
Manager."

In the policy settings, enable the policy and click the "Show..." button for
SubscriptionManagers. Enter the server details for your WEC:

```
Server=http://WEC_FQDN:5985/wsman/SubscriptionManager/WEC,Refresh=60
```

Replace `WEC_FQDN` with the actual FQDN of your WEC.

#### Apply the local group policy

Refresh the Local Group Policy settings and apply the changes by running:

```
gpupdate /force
```

On the WEC, now [verify that the machine forwards
events](#verify-the-subscription).

## Collect logs via OpenWEC

Instead of natively running a WEC on a Windows machine, you can also run the
third-party implementation [OpenWEC](https://github.com/cea-sec/openwec).

![OpenWEC](windows-event-logs/windows-events-openwec.svg)

From a functional perspective, this setup is identical to running a native WEC,
but it does not require an additional agent at the WEC. In addition, OpenWEC can
be scaled redundantly for high availability setups.

### Setup OpenWEC

Refer to the [OpenWEC getting started
guide](https://github.com/cea-sec/openwec/blob/main/doc/getting_started.md) for
setup instructions.

For running OpenWEC on non-Windows machines that are likely not joined to a
Windows domain, it is most useful to configure TLS client authentication. The
OpenWEC documentation (see above) recommends to use [a script collection from
NXLog][nxlog-scripts] that creates keys/certificates that can immediately be
used to configure both Windows clients and the OpenWEC collector. Make sure to
pay attention to specifying the correct hostnames for the sending and receiving
machines.

[nxlog-scripts]: https://gitlab.com/nxlog-public/contrib/-/tree/master/windows-event-forwarding

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/nxlog-public/contrib
cd contrib/windows-event-forwarding
./genca.sh myca
./gencert-client.sh myclient.domain.com
./gencert-server.sh openwec.domain.com
```

Use the following for the Subscription Manager string:

```
Server=HTTPS://openwec.domain.com:5985/wsman/,Refresh=14400,IssuerCA=6605742C5400141B76A747E19EA585E29B09F017
```

The string in the last line can be used to configure the Windows Event
Forwarding subscription manager on the sending side as described in the section
above ("Change local group policy settings"). While you're at it, also import
the `client.pfx` and `ca-cert.pem` into the corresponding stores (see [the
documentation](https://github.com/cea-sec/openwec/blob/main/doc/tls.md#client-configuration)).

Then, configure the OpenWEC server as follows (assuming the output files are in
`/etc`, the directory `/var/db/openwec` exists and it is writable by the current
user):

```toml title="openwec.conf.toml"
[server]

[logging]
verbosity = "info"

[database]
type = "SQLite"
path = "/var/db/openwec/openwec.sqlite"

[[collectors]]
listen_address = "0.0.0.0"
hostname = "openwec.domain.com"

[collectors.authentication]
type = "Tls"
ca_certificate = "/etc/ca-cert.pem"
server_certificate = "/etc/server-cert.pem"
server_private_key = "/etc/server-key.pem"
```

Create the database (only needs to be done once):

```bash
openwec -c openwec.conf.toml db init
```

Start the server:

```bash
openwecd -c openwec.conf.toml
```

```
2024-01-30T13:59:26.295792509+01:00 INFO server - Server settings: Server { db_sync_interval: None, flush_heartbeats_interval: None, heartbeats_queue_size: None, node_name: None, keytab: None, tcp_keepalive_time: None, tcp_keepalive_intvl: None, tcp_keepalive_probes: None }
2024-01-30T13:59:26.295947557+01:00 INFO server::subscription - reload_subscriptions task started
2024-01-30T13:59:26.296046314+01:00 INFO server::heartbeat - Heartbeat task started
2024-01-30T13:59:26.297503212+01:00 WARN server::subscription - There are no active subscriptions!
2024-01-30T13:59:26.306151854+01:00 INFO server::tls - Loaded TLS configuration with server certificate /etc/server-cert.pem
2024-01-30T13:59:26.309876793+01:00 INFO server - Server listenning on 0.0.0.0:5985
```

It might make sense to ensure that the server is started and kept up via some
automated means, like systemd.

Then, while the server is running, create a subscription in OpenWEC for the
desired channels. For example, to match the subscription from the example above,
create an XML file like this:

```xml title="subscription.xml"
<QueryList>
    <Query Id="0">
        <Select Path="Application">*</Select>
        <Select Path="Security">*</Select>
        <Select Path="System">*</Select>
    </Query>
</QueryList>
```

Pass this file to `openwec` to create a subscription, e.g., with name
`DC_SUBSCRIPTION`:

```bash
openwec subscriptions new DC_SUBSCRIPTION subscription.xml
```

For the new subscription, configure JSON over TCP as
[output](https://github.com/cea-sec/openwec/blob/main/doc/outputs.md):

```bash
openwec subscriptions edit DC_SUBSCRIPTION outputs add --format json tcp 10.0.0.1 1514
```

Finally, enable the subscription:

```bash
openwec subscriptions enable DC_SUBSCRIPTION
```

That's it! You should now be able read the Windows event logs in JSON format by
spinning up a server that listens at `tcp://10.0.0.1:1514`.

### Run a Tenzir pipeline

Accept the logs sent with the configuration above into Tenzir via
[TCP](/integrations/tcp):

```tql
from "tcp://10.0.0.1:1514" {
  read_json
}
publish "wec"
```

## Increase visibility with Sysmon

[Sysmon](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon) (System
Monitor) is a Windows system service and device driver that, once installed on a
system, remains resident across system reboots to monitor and log system
activity to the Windows event log. Key features include:

- **Process creation tracking**: Logs details of new processes.
- **Network connection monitoring**: Records incoming and outgoing network
  connections.
- **File creation time changes**: Tracks changes to file creation times.
- **Driver and image load monitoring**: Logs loading of drivers and DLL files.
- **Registry tracking**: Monitors changes to the Windows registry.

### Download and extract Sysmon via Powershell

Download Sysmon:

```ps
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://download.sysinternals.com/files/Sysmon.zip" -OutFile "Sysmon.zip"
```

Extract the archive:

```
Expand-Archive -Path Sysmon.zip -DestinationPath Sysmon
```

### Choose a Symon configuration

Choose a suitable Sysmon configuration, e.g., from [Florian
Roth](https://github.com/Neo23x0/sysmon-config/) or
[SwiftOnSecurity](https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config):

```ps
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Neo23x0/sysmon-config/master/sysmonconfig-export.xml" -OutFile "sysmonconfig-export.xml"
```

### Install Symon with a configuration

```ps
.\Sysmon64.exe -accepteula -i sysmonconfig-export.xml
```

Now use any of the above techniques to collect event logs through the channel
`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`.
