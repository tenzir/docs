[Snowflake](https://snowflake.com) is a multi-cloud data warehouse. Tenzir can
send events from a pipeline to [Snowflake
databases](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/ddl-database).

![Snowflake](snowflake.svg)

Use the [`to_snowflake`](/reference/operators/to_snowflake) output operator
at the end of a pipeline to send events to a specific table.

:::note[ADBC]
Tenzir uses [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org) under the hood to encode
batches of events into a columnar representation. The [Arrow Database
Connectivity (ADBC)](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/ADBC.html) API makes
makes it possible to efficiently transfer large datasets between Tenzir and a
database. Think of ADBC as the columnar equivalent of JDBC/ODBC. ADBC has a
[Snowflake driver](https://arrow.apache.org/adbc/current/driver/snowflake.html)
that Tenzir uses to send events to Snowflake with the bulk ingestion API. For
further details on ADBC, read the [introductory blog
post](https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2023/01/05/introducing-arrow-adbc/) from the
Arrow project.
