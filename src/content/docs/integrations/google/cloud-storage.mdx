[Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage) is Google's object storage
service. Tenzir can treat it like a local filesystem to read and write files.

:::tip[URL Support]
The URL scheme `gs://` dispatches to
[`load_gcs`](../../../reference/operators/load_gcs) and
[`save_gcs`](../../../reference/operators/save_gcs) for seamless URL-style use via
[`from`](../../../reference/operators/from) and
[`to`](../../../reference/operators/to).
