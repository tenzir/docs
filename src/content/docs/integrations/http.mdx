[HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP) is the foundation of data exchange
on the web. Tenzir provides operators for both sides of an HTTP conversation:
fetching data from APIs and accepting incoming requests.

## Fetching Data from APIs

When retrieving data from an API or website, you prepare your HTTP request and
get back the HTTP response body as your pipeline data:

![HTTP from](http-from.svg)

Use [`from_http`](/reference/operators/from_http) to issue a one-shot HTTP
request, or [`http`](/reference/operators/http) to enrich events flowing through
a pipeline with HTTP responses. Both operators automatically infer the response
format from the URL extension or `Content-Type` header.

See the [Fetch via HTTP and APIs](/guides/collecting/fetch-via-http-and-apis)
guide for practical examples covering authentication, pagination, error
handling, and data enrichment.

## Accepting Incoming Requests

Use [`accept_http`](/reference/operators/accept_http) to spin up an HTTP server
that turns incoming requests into pipeline events. This is useful for receiving
webhooks, building custom API endpoints, or ingesting data pushed by external
systems.

## Sending Data to APIs

When sending data from a pipeline to an API or website, the events in the
pipeline make up the HTTP request body:

![HTTP to](http-to.svg)

Use [`save_http`](/reference/operators/save_http) with a write operator to send
pipeline data as an HTTP request body.

## SSL/TLS

All HTTP operators support TLS. Pass `tls={}` to enable TLS with defaults, or
provide a record with specific options like `certfile` and `keyfile`.
