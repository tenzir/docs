[Graylog](https://graylog.org/) is a log management solution based on top of
OpenSearch. Tenzir can send data to and receive data from Graylog.[^1]

[^1]:
    This guide focuses currently focuses only on receiving data to Graylog,
    although it's already possible to send data to Graylog.

## Receive data from Graylog

To receive data from Graylog with a Tenzir pipeline, you need to configure a new
output and setup a stream that sends data to that output. The example below
assumes that Graylog sends data in GELF to a TCP endpoint that listens on
IP address 1.2.3.4 at port 5678.

### Configure a GELF TCP output

1. Navigate to _System/Outputs_ in Graylog's web interface.
2. Click _Manage Outputs_.
3. Select `GELF TCP` as the output type.
4. Configure the output settings:
   - Specify the target server's address in the `host` field (e.g., `1.2.3.4`).
   - Enter the port number for the TCP connection (e.g., `5678`).
   - Optionally adjust other settings like reconnect delay, queue size, and send
     buffer size.
5. Save the configuration.

Now Graylog will forward messages in GELF format to the specified TCP endpoint.

### Create a Graylog stream

The newly created output still needs to be connected to a stream to produce
data. For example, to route all incoming traffic in Graylog to an output:

1. Go to _Streams_ in the Graylog web interface.
2. Create a new stream or edit an existing one.
3. In the stream's settings, configure it to match all incoming messages. You
   can do this by setting up a rule that matches all messages or by leaving the
   rules empty.
4. Once the stream is configured, go to the _Outputs_ tab in the stream's
   settings.
5. Add the previously configured GELF TCP output to this stream.

This setup will direct all messages that arrive in Graylog to the specified
output. Adapt your filters for more fine-grained forwarding.

### Test the connection with a Tenzir pipeline

Now that Graylog is configured, you can test that data is flowing using the
following Tenzir pipeline:

```tql
from "tcp://1.2.3.4:5678" {
  read_gelf
}
```

This pipelines opens a listening socket at IP address 1.2.3.4 at port 5678 via
[`from`](/reference/operators/from) and then spawns a nested pipeline per
accepted connection, each of which reads a stream of GELF messages using
[`read_gelf`](/reference/operators/read_gelf). Graylog will connect to
this socket, based on the reconnect interval that you configured in the output
(by default 500ms).

Now that data is flowing, you can decide what to do with the Graylog data, e.g.,
make available the data on an topic using
[`publish`](/reference/operators/publish):

```tql
from "tcp://1.2.3.4:5678" {
  read_gelf
}
publish "graylog"
```
