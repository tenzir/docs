[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) is an open-source relational database management
system widely used for web applications, data warehousing, and enterprise
applications.

TODO: diagram

Tenzir connects to MySQL over the network using the MySQL wire protocol. Tenzir
communicates with MySQL via the host and port you specify in the
[`from_mysql`](/reference/operators/from_mysql) operator. This means:

- **Network**: Tenzir and MySQL can run on the same machine (using `localhost`)
  or on different machines in the same network. You just need to make sure that
  Tenzir can reach the MySQL server.
- **IPC**: There is no direct inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism; all
  communication uses MySQL's network protocol.
- **Co-deployment**: For best performance and security, deploy Tenzir and MySQL
  in the same trusted network or use TLS for encrypted connections.

## Examples

These examples assume that the MySQL server is running on the same host as
Tenzir.

### List available tables

```tql
from_mysql show="tables", host="localhost", database="mydb"
```

### Execute a custom SQL query

```tql
from_mysql sql=r"SELECT id, name, email FROM users WHERE active = 1",
           host="localhost", database="mydb"
```
