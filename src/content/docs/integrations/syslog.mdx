title: Syslog
---

Tenzir supports parsing and emitting Syslog messages across multiple transport
protocols, including both UDP and TCP. This enables seamless integration with
Syslog-based systems for ingesting or exporting logs.

![Syslog](syslog.svg)

Syslog support in Tenzir is powered by two components:

- [`read_syslog`](/reference/operators/read_syslog): a parser that turns
  unstructured Syslog messages into structured events.
- [`write_syslog`](/reference/operators/write_syslog): a printer that
  transforms structured events into compliant Syslog messages.

Together, these building blocks enable round-trip Syslog processing.

## Examples

### Create a Syslog Server

To receive Syslog messages on a UDP socket, use `from` with
[`read_syslog`](/reference/operators/read_syslog):

```tql
from "udp://0.0.0.0:514", insert_newlines=true {
  read_syslog
}
publish "syslog"
```

To use TCP instead of UDP, change the scheme and omit the `insert_newlines`
option:

```tql
from "tcp://0.0.0.0:514" {
  read_syslog
}
publish "syslog"
```

:::note[One pipeline per accepted connection]
For TCP, the pipeline inside `from` executes _for each accepted
connection_.

### Parsing CEF, LEEF, or JSON Payloads

If your Syslog messages embed structured formats like CEF, LEEF, or JSON, you
can follow up with an additional parser. For example, assume you have a Syslog
message that includes CEF:

```txt
Nov 13 16:00:02 host123 FOO: CEF:0|FORCEPOINT|Firewall|6.6.1|78002|TLS connection state|0|deviceExternalId=Master FW node 1 dvc=10.1.1.40 dvchost=10.1.1.40 msg=TLS: Couldn't establish TLS connection (11, N/A) deviceFacility=Management rt=Jan 17 2020 08:52:09
```

Why you throw [`read_syslog`](/reference/operators/read_syslog) at this
line, you'll get this output:

```tql title="sample.syslog"
{
  facility: null,
  severity: null,
  timestamp: "Nov 13 16:00:02",
  hostname: "host123",
  app_name: "FOO",
  process_id: null,
  content: "CEF:0|FORCEPOINT|Firewall|6.6.1|78002|TLS connection state|0|deviceExternalId=Master FW node 1 dvc=10.1.1.40 dvchost=10.1.1.40 msg=TLS: Couldn't establish TLS connection (11, N/A) deviceFacility=Management rt=Jan 17 2020 08:52:09",
}
```

Note that the `content` field is just a big string. Parse it with
[`parse_cef`](/reference/functions/parse_cef):

```tql
load_file "/tmp/sample.syslog"
read_syslog
content = content.parse_cef()
```

This yields the following structured output:

```tql
{
  facility: null,
  severity: null,
  timestamp: "Nov 13 16:00:02",
  hostname: "host123",
  app_name: "FOO",
  process_id: null,
  content: {
    cef_version: 0,
    device_vendor: "FORCEPOINT",
    device_product: "Firewall",
    device_version: "6.6.1",
    signature_id: "78002",
    name: "TLS connection state",
    severity: "0",
    extension: {
      deviceExternalId: "Master FW node 1",
      dvc: 10.1.1.40,
      dvchost: 10.1.1.40,
      msg: "TLS: Couldn't establish TLS connection (11, N/A)",
      deviceFacility: "Management",
      rt: "Jan 17 2020 08:52:09",
    },
  },
}
```

### Handling Multi-line Syslog Messages

Tenzir's Syslog parser supports multi-line messages using a heuristic:

1. Split the input at newlines.
2. Try parsing the next line as a new Syslog message.
3. If successful, treat it as a new message.
4. If parsing fails, append the line to the current message and repeat.

This allows ingesting logs with stack traces or other verbose content correctly.

## Emit Events as Syslog

Tenzir also supports **creating** Syslog messages from structured events via
[`write_syslog`](/reference/operators/write_syslog).

Here's a basic example that emits a single Syslog line over UDP:

```tql
from {
  facility: 3,
  severity: 6,
  timestamp: 2020-03-02T18:44:46,
  hostname: "parallels-Parallels-Virtual-Platform",
  app_name: "packagekitd",
  process_id: "1370",
  message_id: "",
  structured_data: {},
  message: " PARENT process running...",
}
write_syslog
save_udp "1.2.3.4:514"
```

This pipeline sends the following RFC 5424-formatted message to
`1.2.3.4:514/udp`:

```txt
<30>1 2020-03-02T18:44:46.000000Z parallels-Parallels-Virtual-Platform packagekitd 1370 - -  PARENT process running...
```

### Example with Structured Data

Here is a richer event with structured Syslog fields. Let's create a Syslog
event from it:

```tql
from {
  facility: 20,
  severity: 5,
  version: 8,
  timestamp: 2003-10-11T22:14:15,
  hostname: "mymachineexamplecom",
  app_name: "evntslog",
  process_id: "",
  message_id: "ID47",
  structured_data: {
    "exampleSDID@32473": {
      iut: 5,
      eventSource: "Applic\\ation",
      eventID: 1011,
    },
    "examplePriority@32473": {
      class: "high",
    },
  },
  message: null,
}
write_syslog
```

Output:

```txt
<165>1 2003-10-11T22:14:15.000000Z mymachineexamplecom evntslog - ID47 [exampleSDID@32473 iut="5" eventSource="Applic\\ation" eventID="1011"][examplePriority@32473 class="high"]
```

The [`write_syslog`](/reference/operators/write_syslog) operator converts
the `structured_data` field into a valid [RFC
5424](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5424) structured block.
