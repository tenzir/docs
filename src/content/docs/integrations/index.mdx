A Tenzir **integration** is a specific way to integrate with a third-party tool
or technology.

All integrations rely on [pipelines](/explanations/architecture/pipeline) in
some form. For some applications, there exist _dedicated_ operators, e.g., the
[Splunk](/integrations/splunk) integration using the
[`to_splunk`](/reference/operators/to_splunk) output operator. Integrating with
other applications means merely using an existing _generic_ operator, such as
the [`http`](/reference/operators/http) operator to [fetch data from
APIs](/guides/data-loading/fetch-data-from-apis).

Often, integrations with tools end up as a parameterizable
[package](/explanations/packages) in our freely available [library on
GitHub](https://github.com/tenzir/library). In particular, packages can also
provide [enrichment contexts](/explanations/enrichment/) and accompanying
pipelines that periodically load external data into the context. Several
packages that provide threat intelligence feeds in our library follow this
pattern.
