A Tenzir **integration** is a specific way to integrate with a third-party tool
or technology.

Integrations come in many forms: as a dedicated pipeline operator, e.g., to send
events to [Splunk](/integrations/splunk) using the
[`to_splunk`](/reference/operators/to_splunk) output operator; instructions and
best practices on how to set up external tools with Tenzir, e.g., in the case of
[Windows Event Logs](/integrations/microsoft/windows-event-logs); or as a
[package](/explanations/packages) that bundles example pipelines and contexts to
achieve a particular use case.
