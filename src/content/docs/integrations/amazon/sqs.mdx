title: SQS
---

[Amazon Simple Queuing Service (SQS)](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) is a managed
message queue for microservices, distributed systems, and serverless
applications.

Tenzir can interact with SQS by sending messages to and reading messages from
SQS queues.

![SQS](sqs.svg)

When reading from SQS queues, you cannot specify individual messages. Instead,
you determine the maximum number of messages you wish to retrieve, up to a limit
of 10.

If the parameter `poll_interval` is non-zero, the pipeline automatically
performs [long
polling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-short-and-long-polling.html).
This means that you may receive messages in bursts, according to your specified
poll interval.

Tenzir pipelines that read from an SQS queue automatically send a deletion
request after having received the messages.

:::tip[URL Support]
The URL scheme `sqs://` dispatches to
[`load_sqs`](/reference/operators/load_sqs) and
[`save_sqs`](/reference/operators/save_sqs) for seamless URL-style use via
[`from`](/reference/operators/from) and
[`to`](/reference/operators/to).
