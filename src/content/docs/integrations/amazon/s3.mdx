---

[Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) is an object
storage service. Tenzir can treat it like a local filesystem to read and write
files.

![S3](s3.svg)

Use [`from_s3`](/reference/operators/from_s3) to read files from S3. It supports
glob patterns, automatic format detection, and IAM role assumption. For writing,
use [`save_s3`](/reference/operators/save_s3) with a print operator.

## Configuration

Follow the [standard configuration instructions](/integrations/amazon) to
authenticate with your AWS credentials.

## Examples

### Read from an S3 bucket

```tql
from_s3 "s3://my-bucket/path/to/file.json.gz"
```

### Read all JSON files from an S3 bucket

```tql
from_s3 "s3://my-bucket/logs/**.json"
```

### Write to an S3 bucket

```tql
from {foo: 42}
print_json
compress_gzip
save_s3 "s3://my-bucket/path/to/file.json.gz"
```
