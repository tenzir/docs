storage service. Tenzir can treat it like a local filesystem to read and write
files.

:::tip[URL Support]
The URL scheme `s3://` dispatches to
[`load_s3`](/reference/operators/load_s3) and
[`save_s3`](/reference/operators/save_s3) for seamless URL-style use via
[`from`](/reference/operators/from) and
[`to`](/reference/operators/to).
