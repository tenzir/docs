Tenzir integrates with the services from [Amazon Web
Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com) listed below.

## Configuration

To interact with AWS services, you need to provide appropriate credentials.

### Inline credentials

All AWS operators support an `aws_iam` parameter for specifying credentials
directly in the pipeline:

```tql
load_sqs "my-queue", aws_iam={
  region: "us-east-1",
  access_key_id: "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE",
  secret_access_key: "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"
}
```

You can also use the `aws_iam` parameter to assume an IAM role:

```tql
load_s3 "s3://my-bucket/data.json", aws_iam={
  assume_role: "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyRole",
  session_name: "tenzir-session"
}
```

### Default credential chain

If no `aws_iam` parameter is specified, operators use AWS's [default credentials
provider chain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html).

Make sure to configure AWS credentials for the same user account that runs
`tenzir` and `tenzir-node`. The AWS CLI creates configuration files for the
current user under `~/.aws`, which can only be read by the same user account.

The `tenzir-node` systemd unit by default creates a `tenzir` user and runs as
that user, meaning that the AWS credentials must also be configured for that
user. The directory `~/.aws` must be readable for the `tenzir` user.
