[ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com/) is an open-source column-oriented database
management system designed for efficient storage and retrieval of large amounts
of data. It is particularly well-suited for real-time analytics and data
warehousing applications.

![ClickHouse integration](clickhouse.svg)

Tenzir sends data to ClickHouse using the open-source
[clickhouse-cpp](https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-cpp) library, enabling
efficient columnar transfer of events. The
[`to_clickhouse`](/reference/operators/to_clickhouse) operator can both write to
existing tables and create new tables.

## Examples

### Send a CSV file to a ClickHouse table

```tql
from "my_file.csv"
to_clickhouse table="my_table"
```
