title: shift_left
---

Performs a bit-wise left shift.

```tql
shift_left(lhs:number, rhs:number) -> number
```

## Description

The `shift_left` function performs a bit-wise left shift of `lhs` by `rhs` bit
positions. Each left shift multiplies the number by 2.

### `lhs: number`

The number to be shifted.

### `rhs: number`

The number of bit positions to shift to the left.

## Examples

### Shift bits to the left

```tql
from {x: shift_left(5, 2)}
```

```tql
{x: 20}
```
