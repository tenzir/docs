import Fn from '@components/see-also/Fn.astro';

Computes the bit-wise AND of its arguments.

```tql
bit_and(lhs:number, rhs:number) -> number
```

## Description

The `bit_and` function computes the bit-wise AND of `lhs` and `rhs`. The
operation is performed on each corresponding bit position of the two numbers.

### `lhs: number`

The left-hand side operand.

### `rhs: number`

The right-hand side operand.

## Examples

### Perform bit-wise AND on integers

```tql
from {x: bit_and(5, 3)}
```

```tql
{x: 1}
```
