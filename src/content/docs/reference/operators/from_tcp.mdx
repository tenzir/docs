Connects to a remote TCP or TLS endpoint and receives events.

```tql
from_tcp endpoint:string, [tls=record, { … }]
```

## Description

Connects to the specified TCP endpoint as a client and reads bytes from the
connection, running them through an optional nested pipeline.

If the connection fails, the operator retries with exponential backoff.

### `endpoint: string`

The remote endpoint to connect to. Must be of the form
`[tcp://]<hostname>:<port>`.

### `tls = record (optional)`

import TLSOptions from '@partials/operators/TLSOptions.mdx';

<TLSOptions/>

### `{ … } (optional)`

The pipeline to run for the TCP connection. Use this to parse the incoming byte
stream into events, for instance `{ read_json }`.

The variable `peer` is available inside the pipeline and contains a record with
the fields `ip` and `port` of the remote endpoint.

## Examples

### Connect to a remote server and read JSON

```tql
from_tcp "example.org:4000" {
  read_json
}
```

### Connect with TLS

```tql
from_tcp "example.org:4443", tls={} {
  read_json
}
```

### Connect with TLS and a custom CA certificate

```tql
from_tcp "example.org:4443", tls={cacert: "ca.pem"} {
  read_json
}
```
