Connects to a remote TCP or TLS endpoint and sends events.

```tql
to_tcp endpoint:string, [tls=record] { … }
```

## Description

Connects to the specified TCP endpoint as a client and writes serialized events
to the connection. Input events are run through a nested pipeline that must
produce bytes (e.g., `{ write_json }`).

If the connection fails, the operator reconnects automatically with exponential
backoff.

### `endpoint: string`

The remote endpoint to connect to. Must be of the form
`[tcp://]<hostname>:<port>`.

import TLSOptions from '@partials/operators/TLSOptions.mdx';

<TLSOptions/>

### `{ … }`

The pipeline to serialize input events into bytes. Must produce bytes as output,
for instance `{ write_json }` or `{ write_csv }`.

## Examples

### Send JSON to a remote server

```tql
export
to_tcp "collector.example.com:5044" { write_json }
```

### Send with TLS

```tql
export
to_tcp "collector.example.com:5044", tls={} { write_json }
```
