Runs a subpipeline across multiple parallel workers.

```tql
parallel jobs:int { … }
```

## Description

The `parallel` operator distributes incoming events across multiple parallel
instances of a subpipeline. Each event is processed by exactly one worker.

Use this operator to parallelize CPU-intensive transformations or I/O-bound
operations that would otherwise bottleneck on a single thread.

This operator may reorder the event stream since workers process events
concurrently.

:::caution[Expert Operator]
The `parallel` operator is a building block for performance optimization. Use it
when you have identified a specific bottleneck that benefits from
parallelization. Not all operations scale linearly with parallelism.
:::

### `jobs: int`

The number of parallel workers to spawn. Must be greater than zero.

### `{ … }`

The subpipeline to run in parallel. The subpipeline receives events as input and
may either:

- Produce events as output (transformation)
- End with a sink (void output)

The subpipeline must not produce bytes as output.

## Examples

### Parse JSON in parallel

Parse raw JSON strings across multiple workers:

```tql
subscribe "raw"
parallel 4 {
  parsed = data.parse_json()
}
```

### Make parallel HTTP requests

Send events to Google SecOps with 4 concurrent connections:

```tql
subscribe "events"
parallel 4 {
  to_google_secops customer_id="…", private_key=secret("secops_key"),
                   client_email="…", log_type="…", log_text=raw
}
```
