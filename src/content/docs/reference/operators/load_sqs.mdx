Loads bytes from [Amazon SQS][sqs] queues.

[sqs]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sqs/

```tql
load_sqs queue:str, [poll_time=duration, aws_iam=record]
```

## Description

[Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS)][sqs] is a fully managed message
queuing service to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and
serverless applications. The `load_sqs` operator reads bytes from messages of an
SQS queue.

The `load_sqs` operator uses long polling, which helps reduce your cost of using SQS
by reducing the number of empty responses when there are no messages available
to return in reply to a message request. Use the `poll_time` option to adjust
the timeout.

The operator requires the following AWS permissions:

- `sqs:GetQueueUrl`
- `sqs:ReceiveMessage`
- `sqs:DeleteMessage`

### `queue: str`

The name of the queue to use.

### `poll_time = duration (optional)`

The long polling timeout per request.

The value must be between 1 and 20 seconds.

Defaults to `3s`.

## Examples

Read JSON messages from the SQS queue `tenzir`:

```tql
load_sqs "tenzir"
```

Read JSON messages with a 20-second long poll timeout:

```tql
load_sqs "tenzir", poll_time=20s
```

Read messages using explicit credentials:

```tql
load_sqs "my-queue", aws_iam={
  region: "us-east-1",
  access_key_id: secret("aws-key"),
  secret_access_key: secret("aws-secret")
}
```

Read messages by assuming an IAM role:

```tql
load_sqs "my-queue", aws_iam={
  region: "eu-west-1",
  assume_role: "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-sqs-role",
  session_name: "tenzir-session"
}
```
