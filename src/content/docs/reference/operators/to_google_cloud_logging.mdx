Sends events to **Google Cloud Logging**.

```tql
to_google_cloud_logging name=string, resource_type=string,
        [resource_labels=record, payload=string, service_credentials=string,
        severity=string, timestamp=time, batch_timeout=duration,
        max_batch_size=int]
```

## Description

The `to_google_cloud_logging` operator sends events to [Google Cloud
Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging).

You can either send an unstructured log in the form of a string to Cloud
Logging by explicitly providing the log via the `payload` option, or you can
ignore the `payload` option and the operator will then assemble a JSON object
from the event and send that to Cloud Logging.

### `name = string`

The resource name for the associated log entry. Must have one of the following
formats:

- `projects/[PROJECT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]`
- `organizations/[ORGANIZATION_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]`
- `billingAccounts/[BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]`
- `folders/[FOLDER_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]`

Note the following constraints on `[LOG_ID]`:

- The value must be URL-encoded within `name`, e.g.,
   `"organizations/1234567890/logs/cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com%2Factivity"`.
- The value must be less than 512 characters long.
- The value can only include the following characters:
  - Upper and lower case alphanumeric characters
  - Forward-slash
  - Underscore
  - Hyphen
  - Period

### `resource_type = string`

The type of the [monitored resource](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/reference/v2/rest/v2/MonitoredResource).
All available types with their associated labels are listed
[here](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/api/v2/resource-list).

### `resource_labels = record (optional)`

Record of associated labels for the resource. Values of the record must be of
type `string`.
All available types with their associated labels are listed
[here](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/api/v2/resource-list).

### `payload = string (optional)`

The log entry payload. If unspecified, the incoming event is serialized as JSON
and sent.

### `service_credentials = string (optional)`

Credentials to use if using a service account.

### `severity = string (optional)`

Severity of the event. Available severity levels are documented
[here](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/reference/v2/rest/v2/LogEntry#LogSeverity).

Defaults to `default`.

### `timestamp = time (optional)`

Timestamp of the event.

### `batch_timeout = duration (optional)`

Maximum interval between sending the events.

Defaults to `5s`.

### `max_batch_size = int (optional)`

Maximum events to batch before sending.

Defaults to `1k`.

## Example

### Send logs, authenticating automatically via ADC

```tql
from {
  content: "log message",
  timestamp: now(),
}
to_google_cloud_logging name="projects/PROJECT_ID/logs/LOG_ID",
  resource_type="global"
```

### Send logs using a service account

```tql
from {
  content: "totally not a made up log",
  timestamp: now(),
  resource: "global",
}
to_google_cloud_logging name="projects/PROJECT_ID/logs/LOG_ID",
  resource_type=resource,
  service_credentials=file_contents("/path/to/credentials.json")
```
