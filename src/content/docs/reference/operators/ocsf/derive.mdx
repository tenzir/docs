Automatically assigns enum strings from their integer counterparts and vice
versa.

```tql
ocsf::derive
```

## Description

The `ocsf::derive` operator performs bidirectional enum derivation for OCSF
events by automatically assigning enum string values based on their integer
counterparts and vice versa.

The operator preserves the original field order from the input record. Enum/sibling
pairs are always ordered alphabetically within the pair to match the ordering
used by `ocsf::cast`. For example, `activity_id` comes before `activity_name`,
and `class_name` comes before `class_uid`.

When deriving new fields:

- If both the enum field and its sibling field exist in the input, they are
  emitted in alphabetical order at the position of the first field.
- If only one field exists, the derived counterpart is inserted adjacent to it
  in alphabetical order.
- Non-OCSF fields remain at their original positions.

In the future, this operator will also automatically assign computable values
such as `type_uid` based on what is available in the event.

## Examples

### Integer to string

```tql
from {
  metadata: {
    version: "1.5.0",
  },
  class_uid: 1001,
  activity_id: 1,
}
ocsf::derive
```

```tql
{
  metadata: {
    version: "1.5.0",
  },
  class_name: "File System Activity",
  class_uid: 1001,
  activity_id: 1,
  activity_name: "Create",
}
```

The derived `class_name` appears before `class_uid` (alphabetically), and the
derived `activity_name` appears after `activity_id` (alphabetically). Each pair
is positioned where the original field appeared in the input.

### String to Integer

```tql
from {
  metadata: {
    version: "1.5.0",
  },
  class_uid: 1001,
  activity_name: "Read",
}
ocsf::derive
```

```tql
{
  metadata: {
    version: "1.5.0",
  },
  class_name: "File System Activity",
  class_uid: 1001,
  activity_id: 2,
  activity_name: "Read",
}
```

The derived `activity_id` appears before `activity_name` (alphabetically), and
the derived `class_name` appears before `class_uid` (alphabetically).

### Bidirectional enum validation

```tql
from {
  metadata: {
    version: "1.5.0",
  },
  class_uid: 1001,
  activity_id: 1,
  activity_name: "Delete",  // Inconsistent with activity_id=1
}
ocsf::derive
```

```tql
{
  metadata: {
    version: "1.5.0",
  },
  class_name: "File System Activity",
  class_uid: 1001,
  activity_id: 1,
  activity_name: "Delete",
}
```

This emits a warning about inconsistent values and preserves both original
values without modification, allowing you to decide how to handle the conflict.

```
warning: found inconsistency between `activity_id` and `activity_name`
