title: Platform Configuration
---

This page lists the configuration settings that the Tenzir Platform accepts.

## Environment variables

The Tenzir Platform usually runs as a set of containers in a docker compose
stack. Our [example files](https://github.com/tenzir/platform/tree/main/examples)
pick up certain configuration parameters from environment variables.

To configure the platform, create a file named `.env` in the same directory
as the `docker-compose.yaml` file with your Tenzir Platform stack and set
the environment variables described below.

### General Settings

You must configure these settings for every platform instance.

```sh
# The docker image tag that you use for platform deployment.
TENZIR_PLATFORM_VERSION=latest

# By default, the Tenzir UI Frontend will attempt to communicate directly with
# the Tenzir Gateway to get the current status of all connected nodes.
# When you set this to true, this communication will be proxied through
# the Tenzir UI Backend instead.
TENZIR_PLATFORM_USE_INTERNAL_WS_PROXY=false

# When enabled, this setting will allow users to spawn demo nodes, which will
# be run inside the same docker compose stack as the platform.
TENZIR_PLATFORM_DISABLE_LOCAL_DEMO_NODES=true

# The image that you use for running demo nodes.
TENZIR_PLATFORM_DEMO_NODE_IMAGE=tenzir/tenzir-node:latest

# An optional file defining the static workspace configuration for this
# platform.
TENZIR_PLATFORM_CONFIG_FILE=

# To configure who is an administrator, you provide a list of authentication rules.
# Every user matching any of the provided rules is considered to be an administrator
# of this platform instance, and will be allowed to use the `tenzir-platform admin` CLI commands.
# Use the `tenzir-platform tools print-auth-rule` CLI command to get valid rules to insert here.
TENZIR_PLATFORM_ADMIN_RULES=[]

# An arbitrary random string used as key to encrypt frontend cookies.
# Generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`.
TENZIR_PLATFORM_INTERNAL_AUTH_SECRET=

# An arbitrary random string used to generate user keys.
# Generate with `openssl rand 32 | base64`.
TENZIR_PLATFORM_INTERNAL_TENANT_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY=

# An arbitrary random string used by the app to access restricted API endpoints.
# Generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`.
TENZIR_PLATFORM_INTERNAL_APP_API_KEY=
```

### External Connectivity

These settings define the outward-facing interface of the Tenzir Platform.

```sh
# The domain under which the Tenzir UI is reachable,
# eg. `https://app.tenzir.example`
# You must route this to the `app` service by the external HTTPS proxy.
TENZIR_PLATFORM_UI_ENDPOINT=

# The domain under which the api is reachable,
# eg. `https://api.tenzir.example`
# You must route this to the `platform` service by the external HTTPS proxy.
TENZIR_PLATFORM_API_ENDPOINT=

# The endpoint to which tenzir nodes should connect.
# Should be a url with `ws://` or `wss://` scheme, eg. `wss://nodes.tenzir.example`.
# You must route this to the `websocket-gateway` service by the external HTTPS proxy.
TENZIR_PLATFORM_NODES_ENDPOINT=

# The url where the blob storage is exposed, eg. `https://downloads.tenzir.example`.
# If you use the bundled blob storage, you must route it to the `seaweed` service
# by the external HTTPS proxy.
TENZIR_PLATFORM_DOWNLOADS_ENDPOINT=
```

### Identity Provider

In your identity provider, you must create the OAuth clients for the
Tenzir Platform and fill in the values below so the platform can connect.

```sh
# A short identifier for the OIDC provider. (e.g. 'auth0', 'keycloak', ...)
TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_PROVIDER_NAME=

# The OIDC provider used for logging into the platform.
TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_PROVIDER_ISSUER_URL=

# A JSON object containing the OIDC issuer and audiences that the platform should accept.
# Example: '{"issuer": "keycloak.example.org", "audiences": ["tenzir_platform"]}'
TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_TRUSTED_AUDIENCES=

# The client id used by the Tenzir Platform CLI.
TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_CLI_CLIENT_ID=

# The client id and client secret used by the Tenzir UI.
TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_UI_CLIENT_ID=
TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_UI_CLIENT_SECRET=
```

### Database

You need to specify the following environment variables so the Tenzir Platform can connect
to a postgres instance.

```sh
TENZIR_PLATFORM_POSTGRES_USER=
TENZIR_PLATFORM_POSTGRES_PASSWORD=
TENZIR_PLATFORM_POSTGRES_DB=
TENZIR_PLATFORM_POSTGRES_HOSTNAME=
```

### Blob Storage

```sh
# When you use S3 or another external blob storage, you must create the bucket and
# provide a valid access key with read and write permissions on the bucket.
# When you use the bundled seaweed instance, you can set these values to arbitrary
# strings.
TENZIR_PLATFORM_INTERNAL_BUCKET_NAME=
TENZIR_PLATFORM_INTERNAL_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
TENZIR_PLATFORM_INTERNAL_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
```

## Configuration File

At the moment, you can configure only a subset of the Tenzir Platform with
a configuration file. Specifically, currently you can configure only static
workspaces.

```yaml
---
workspaces:
  static0:
    # The name of this workspace
    name: Tenzir

    # The category for this workspace in the workspace switcher.
    category: Statically Configured Workspaces

    # The icon to use for this workspace.
    icon-url: https://storage.googleapis.com/tenzir-public-data/icons/tenzir-logo-square.svg

    # Knowledge of this token allows nodes to connect to this workspace
    # as ephemeral nodes.
    token: wsk_e9ee76d4faf4b213745dd5c99a9be11f501d7009ded63f2d5NmDS38vXR
    #  - or -
    # token-file: /path/to/token

    # Everybody can access this workspace.
    auth-rules:
      - { "auth_fn": "auth_allow_all" }

    # Define one example dashboard.
    dashboards:
      dashboard1:
        name: Example Dashboard
        cells:
          - name: Dashboard 1
            definition: |
              partitions
              where not internal
              summarize events=sum(events), schema
              sort -events
            type: table
            x: 0
            y: 0
            w: 12
            h: 12
```
