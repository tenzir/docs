title: Test Framework
---

The [`tenzir-test`](https://github.com/tenzir/test) harness discovers and runs
integration tests for pipelines, fixtures, and custom runners. Use this page as
a reference for concepts, configuration, and CLI details. For step-by-step
walkthroughs, see the guides for [running tests](/guides/testing/run-tests),
[writing tests](/guides/testing/write-tests),
[creating fixtures](/guides/testing/create-fixtures), and
[adding custom runners](/guides/testing/add-custom-runners).

## Install

`tenzir-test` ships as a Python package that requires Python 3.12 or later.
Install it with [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (or `pip`) and verify the
console script:

```sh
uv add tenzir-test
uvx tenzir-test --help
```

## Core concepts

- **Project root** – Directory passed to `--root`; typically contains
  `fixtures/`, `inputs/`, `runners/`, and `tests/`.
- **Mode** – Auto-detected as _project_ or _package_. A `package.yaml` in the
  current directory (or its parent when you run from `<package>/tests`)
  switches to package mode.
- **Library** – A root that contains multiple packages (each with a
  `package.yaml` and its own `tests/`). The harness can discover all packages
  under such a library root and run their suites in one invocation. Use
  `--package-dirs` to load packages so their operators can cross-import.
- **Test** – Any supported file under `tests/`; frontmatter controls execution.
- **Runner** – Named strategy that executes a test (`tenzir`, `python`, custom
  entries).
- **Fixture** – Reusable environment provider registered under `fixtures/` and
  requested via frontmatter.
- **Suite** – Directory-owned group of tests that share fixtures and run
  sequentially. Declare it with `suite:` in a `test.yaml`; all descendants join
  automatically.
- **Input** – Data accessed with `TENZIR_INPUTS`; defaults to `<root>/inputs` but
  you can override it per directory or per test with an `inputs:` setting. The
  harness also supports inline inputs via `TENZIR_INPUT` for test-specific data
  files.
- **Stdin** – Content piped to the test process via a `.stdin` file placed next
  to the test. The harness exposes the file path via `TENZIR_STDIN` and
  automatically pipes its content to the subprocess stdin.
- **Scratch directory** – Ephemeral workspace exposed as `TENZIR_TMP_DIR` during
  each test run.
- **Artifact / Baseline** – Runner output persisted next to the test; regenerate
  with `--update`.
- **Configuration sources** – Frontmatter plus inherited `test.yaml` files;
  `tenzir.yaml` still configures the Tenzir binary.

A typical project layout looks like this:

```text
project-root/
├── fixtures/
│   └── __init__.py
├── inputs/
│   └── sample.ndjson
├── runners/
│   └── __init__.py
└── tests/
    ├── alerts/
    │   ├── sample.tql
    │   └── sample.txt
    ├── parsing/
    │   ├── csv.input           # Inline input for this test
    │   ├── csv.tql
    │   └── csv.txt
    ├── shell/
    │   ├── echo.sh
    │   ├── echo.stdin          # Stdin content piped to the test
    │   └── echo.txt
    └── python/
        └── quick-check.py
```

For a package layout (with `package.yaml`), the structure may look like:

```text
my-package/
├── package.yaml
├── operators/
│   └── custom-op.tql
├── pipelines/
│   └── smoke.tql
└── tests/
    ├── inputs/
    │   └── sample.ndjson
    ├── fixtures/
    │   └── __init__.py
    ├── runners/
    │   └── __init__.py
    └── pipelines/
        ├── custom-op.tql
        └── custom-op.txt
```

## Execution modes and packages

- Mode resolution:
  - `--root` with `tests/` → **project mode**.
  - `--root` (or its parent when named `tests`) with a `package.yaml` →
    **package mode**.
- In **package mode** the harness exposes:
  - `TENZIR_PACKAGE_ROOT` – Absolute package directory.
  - `TENZIR_INPUTS` – `<package>/tests/inputs/` unless a directory `test.yaml`
    or the test frontmatter overrides it.
  - `--package-dirs=<package>` – Passed automatically to the `tenzir` binary.
- Without a manifest the harness stays in **project mode**, recursively
  discovers tests under `tests/`, and applies global fixtures, runners, and
  inputs.

## CLI reference

Run the tests from the project root:

```sh
uvx tenzir-test
```

Useful options:

- `--update`: Rewrite reference artifacts next to each test.
- `--purge`: Remove generated artifacts (diffs, text outputs) from previous
  runs.
- `--jobs N`: Control concurrency (`4 * CPU cores` by default).
- `--coverage` and `--coverage-source-dir`: Enable LLVM coverage.
- `-k`, `--keep`: Preserve per-test scratch directories instead of deleting
  them (same as setting `TENZIR_KEEP_TMP_DIRS=1`).
- `--package-dirs <path>`: Extra package directories for Tenzir binaries.
  Repeatable and accepts comma-separated lists. Entries merge with any
  `package-dirs:` declared in directory `test.yaml` files, then get
  normalized, de-duplicated, and exported via `TENZIR_PACKAGE_DIRS`.
- `--debug`: Emit framework-level diagnostics (fixture lifecycle, discovery
  notes, comparison targets, etc.) and automatically enable verbose output so
  you see all test results (pass/skip/fail) instead of only failures. The same
  mode is available via `TENZIR_TEST_DEBUG=1`.
- `--summary`: Print the tabular breakdown and failure tree after each project.
- `--diff/--no-diff`: Toggle unified diff output for failed comparisons. Diffs
  are shown by default; disable them when you only need aggregated statistics.
- `--diff-stat/--no-diff-stat`: Show (or suppress) the per-file change counter,
  which summarises additions and deletions even when the diff body is hidden.
- `-p`, `--passthrough`: Stream raw stdout/stderr to the terminal instead of
  comparing against reference artifacts. The harness forces single-job
  execution (overriding `--jobs` when necessary) and ignores `--update` while
  passthrough is active. Passthrough mode automatically enables verbose output.
- `-v`, `--verbose`: Print individual test results as they complete. By default
  (quiet mode) the harness only shows failures and a compact summary,
  significantly reducing noise for large test suites. Verbose mode displays
  passing and skipped tests alongside failures. Use `--summary` together with
  `--verbose` to include the tree summary at the end of the run.
- `-a`, `--all-projects`: Run the root project together with any satellites
  provided on the command line.
- `-m`, `--match`: Select tests whose relative path matches a substring or glob
  pattern. Bare strings (without `*`, `?`, or `[`) match as substrings, so
  `-m mysql` selects any test with "mysql" anywhere in its path. Patterns
  containing glob metacharacters use fnmatch syntax. Repeatable; tests matching
  any pattern are selected. When combined with positional TEST paths, only tests
  matching both are run (intersection).
- `--fixture`: Activate fixtures in standalone foreground mode without running
  tests. Repeatable. Accepts bare names (`--fixture mysql`) or YAML mapping
  specs (`--fixture 'kafka: {port: 9092}'`). When provided, positional TEST
  arguments are not allowed. See the [run fixtures](/guides/testing/run-fixtures)
  guide.

Set `TENZIR_TEST_DEBUG=1` in CI when you want the same diagnostics without
passing `--debug` on the command line.

## Python API

The harness is also available as a typed Python library. Import `tenzir_test`
and call `execute()` when you need to run scenarios from automation or another
tool without shelling out to the CLI:

```python
from pathlib import Path

from tenzir_test import ExecutionResult, execute

result: ExecutionResult = execute(tests=[Path("tests/pipeline.tql")])
if result.exit_code:
    # propagate non-zero status to your orchestration layer
    raise SystemExit(result.exit_code)
for project in result.project_results:
    print(project.selection.root, project.summary.total)
```

The helper mirrors the CLI options but returns an `ExecutionResult` with
aggregated `Summary` objects and metadata you can inspect or serialize. Errors
surface as `HarnessError` exceptions so callers can control reporting and retry
logic.

## Selections

A _selection_ is the ordered list of positional paths you pass after the CLI
flags. Each element can point to a single test file, a directory, or an entire
project. The harness resolves every element relative to the current working
directory first and then relative to the root project. How you shape the
selection determines which projects run:

- No positional arguments → run every test in the root project.
- Paths inside the root project → run only those targets (plus any explicitly
  named satellites).
- Paths that resolve to satellite projects → run those satellites, skipping the
  root unless you also request it.

Use `--all-projects` when you want the root project to execute alongside a
selection that only names satellites. This keeps the CLI predictable: the
selection lists the exact satellites you care about, and the flag opts the root
back in without duplicating its path on the command line.

## Suites

Suites let you run several tests under one shared fixture lifecycle. Declare a
suite in a directory-level `test.yaml`; the definition applies to every test
under that directory, including nested subdirectories.

```yaml
# tests/http/test.yaml
suite: smoke-http
fixtures: [http]
timeout: 45
```

Key rules:

- Suites are directory-owned. Once a `test.yaml` sets `suite`, all descendants
  belong to that suite. Put tests that should remain independent outside the
  suite directory or in a sibling directory with a different suite.
- Per-test frontmatter may not declare `suite`.
- Suite members inherit the directory defaults and can still override most keys
  on a per-file basis. The exceptions are `fixtures` and `retry`, which must be
  defined at the directory level once a suite is active so every member agrees
  on the shared lifecycle. Outside suites you can still set those keys directly
  in frontmatter.
- The harness runs suite members sequentially in lexicographic order of their
  relative paths. Each suite occupies a single worker, but different suites can
  run in parallel when `--jobs` allows it.
- The CLI executes all suites before any remaining standalone tests so shared
  fixtures start and stop predictably.
- Run the directory that defines the suite (for example `tenzir-test tests/http`)
  when you want to focus on it. Selecting an individual member now raises an
  error so every run exercises the full lifecycle and shared fixtures stay in sync.

## Inputs

Tests access input data through the `TENZIR_INPUTS` environment variable. By
default this points to `<root>/inputs` or `<package>/tests/inputs/` in package
mode. The harness supports two additional mechanisms for placing inputs closer
to the tests that use them.

### Inline inputs

Place a `.input` file next to a test to provide test-specific input data. The
harness exposes the file path via `TENZIR_INPUT` (singular):

```text
tests/parsing/
  parse-csv.input      # Input data for this test
  parse-csv.tql        # Test file
  parse-csv.txt        # Expected output baseline
```

Access the inline input in TQL:

```tql
from_file env("TENZIR_INPUT")
read_csv
```

Or in a shell script:

```sh
cat "$TENZIR_INPUT" | tenzir 'read_csv'
```

The harness sets `TENZIR_INPUT` only when a matching `.input` file exists. Tests
can use both `TENZIR_INPUT` and `TENZIR_INPUTS` together when they need a
test-specific file plus access to shared data.

### Local inputs directories

Place an `inputs/` directory at any level in the test hierarchy to provide
shared inputs for tests in that subtree. The harness walks up from each test
directory and uses the nearest `inputs/` directory it finds:

```text
tests/
  network/
    inputs/               # Shared inputs for network tests
      sample.pcap
      flows.ndjson
    tcp/
      analysis.tql        # env("TENZIR_INPUTS") → ../inputs/
      analysis.txt
    udp/
      stats.tql
      stats.txt
inputs/                   # Global inputs (fallback)
  common.json
```

Resolution hierarchy for `TENZIR_INPUTS`:

1. `inputs:` override in test frontmatter or `test.yaml` (highest priority)
2. Nearest `inputs/` directory walking up from the test directory
3. Package-level `tests/inputs/` directory
4. Project-level `inputs/` directory (fallback)

When multiple `inputs/` directories exist in the hierarchy, the nearest one
shadows the others. This keeps the mental model simple: move inputs closer to
the tests that use them without worrying about inheritance.

### Stdin inputs

Place a `.stdin` file next to a test to provide content that the harness pipes
to the subprocess stdin. For TQL tests, this lets pipelines start with a parser
directly as an alternative to using `.input` files with `from_file`:

```text
tests/parsing/
  csv.stdin          # CSV data piped to stdin
  csv.tql            # Test file starting with read_csv
  csv.txt            # Expected output baseline
```

The TQL test reads directly from stdin:

```tql
read_csv
sort name
```

For shell scripts, the same mechanism applies:

```text
tests/shell/
  echo.stdin         # Content piped to stdin
  echo.sh            # Test file
  echo.txt           # Expected output baseline
```

```sh
#!/bin/sh
cat
```

The harness pipes the contents of the `.stdin` file automatically. Tests can
combine `.stdin` with `.input` when they need both stdin content and a
test-specific input file:

```text
tests/shell/
  process.stdin      # Content piped to stdin
  process.input      # Input file accessible via TENZIR_INPUT
  process.sh         # Test file
  process.txt        # Expected output baseline
```

A script using both mechanisms:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
echo "from stdin:"
cat
echo "from TENZIR_INPUT:"
cat "$TENZIR_INPUT"
```

The harness sets `TENZIR_STDIN` only when a matching `.stdin` file exists. TQL
tests can also combine both mechanisms—start with a parser for stdin data while
using `env("TENZIR_INPUT")` to reference additional files.

## Run a subset of tests

Pass individual files or directories to run specific tests:

```sh
uvx tenzir-test tests/alerts/high-severity.tql
```

You can list multiple paths in a single invocation. `tenzir-test` wires every
argument into the same runner and fixture registry, so you can mix scenarios
from the project and external checkouts:

```sh
uvx tenzir-test tests/alerts ../contrib/plugins/*/tests
```

### Filter tests by pattern

Use `-m`/`--match` to select tests by matching against their relative path.
Bare strings default to substring matching, so you can write short keywords
without glob syntax:

```sh
uvx tenzir-test -m mysql         # runs every test with "mysql" in its path
uvx tenzir-test -m connect       # runs every test with "connect" in its path
```

Patterns containing glob metacharacters (`*`, `?`, `[`) still use fnmatch
syntax, which is fully backwards-compatible:

```sh
uvx tenzir-test -m '*mysql*'             # equivalent to -m mysql
uvx tenzir-test -m 'tests/*/connect.tql' # glob with wildcard
```

Repeat the flag to match multiple patterns (logical OR):

```sh
uvx tenzir-test -m context -m create     # tests matching either substring
```

When you combine positional TEST paths with `-m` patterns, the harness runs
only tests that satisfy both constraints (intersection):

```sh
uvx tenzir-test tests/integrations/ -m mysql  # only mysql tests under integrations/
```

If a matched test belongs to a suite (configured via `test.yaml`), all tests in
that suite are included automatically so the shared fixture lifecycle stays
intact.

### Run multiple projects with one command

Pass additional project directories after `--root` to execute several projects
in one go. Include `--all-projects` so the root executes next to its satellites.
The directory given to `--root` acts as the **root project**; all other
directories are treated as **satellites**:

```sh
uvx tenzir-test --root example-project --all-projects example-satellite
```

The harness prints a project listing before execution that identifies each
project with a marker and path:

```text
i found 3 projects
i   ■ test
i   □ ../contrib/plugins/context/test
i   □ ../contrib/plugins/packages/test
```

Marker semantics:

- **Filled markers** indicate the root project; **empty markers** indicate
  satellites.
- **Squares** (■ □) represent regular projects; **circles** (● ○) represent
  packages or libraries.

Satellite paths display relative to the root project, making projects with
identical directory names distinguishable.

Key rules:

- The root project provides the baseline configuration (fixtures, runners,
  `test.yaml` defaults, inputs). Satellites layer their own fixtures and
  runners on top; duplicate names raise an error so conflicts surface early.
- Paths printed in the CLI summary are relative to the working directory. The
  harness announces each project before running it and lists the runner mix per
  project for quick insight.
- You can target subsets inside each project with additional positional
  arguments (`tenzir-test --root main --all-projects secondary tests/smoke`).
  When you skip `--root` entirely and only list satellite directories, the
  harness runs those satellites in isolation.
- Satellites keep their own `tests/`, `inputs/`, `fixtures/`, and `runners/`
  folders. A root project can host shared assets that satellites reuse without
  duplication—for example, the example repository includes an
  `example-satellite/` directory that consumes the `xxd` runner exported by the
  root project while defining a satellite-specific fixture.

To regenerate baselines while targeting a specific binary and project root:

```sh
TENZIR_BINARY=/opt/tenzir/bin/tenzir \
TENZIR_NODE_BINARY=/opt/tenzir/bin/tenzir-node \
uvx tenzir-test --root tests --update
```

## Runners

| Runner   | Command/behavior                       | Input extension | Artifact |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------- | -------- |
| `tenzir` | `tenzir -f <test>`                     | `.tql`          | `.txt`   |
| `python` | Execute with the active Python runtime | `.py`           | `.txt`   |
| `shell`  | `sh -eu <test>` via the harness helper | `.sh`           | varies   |

Selection flow:

1. The harness chooses the first registered runner that claimed the file
   extension.
2. Default suffix mapping applies when no runner explicitly claims an extension:
   `.tql → tenzir`, `.py → python`, `.sh → shell`.
3. A `runner: <name>` frontmatter entry overrides the automatic choice.
4. If no runner claims the extension and none is specified in frontmatter, the
   harness fails with an error instead of guessing.

### Shell runner

Place scripts (for example under `tests/shell/`) with the `.sh` suffix to run
them under `bash -eu` via the `shell` runner. The harness also prepends
`<root>/_shell` to `PATH` so project-specific helper binaries become
discoverable. The runner captures stdout and stderr (like `2>&1`) and compares
the combined output with `<test>.txt`; run `tenzir-test --update path/to/test.sh`
when you need to refresh the baseline.

Register custom runners in `runners/__init__.py` via
`tenzir_test.runners.register()` or the `@tenzir_test.runners.startup()`
decorator. Use `replace=True` to override a bundled runner or
`register_alias()` to publish alternate names.

The [runner guide](/guides/testing/add-custom-runners) contains a full example
(`XxdRunner`).

### Passthrough-aware subprocesses

When passthrough mode is active the harness streams stdout/stderr directly to
the terminal and skips reference comparisons. Runner implementations can
respect this automatically by spawning processes through
`tenzir_test.run.run_subprocess(...)`. The helper captures output when the
harness needs it and inherits the parent descriptors otherwise. Pass
`force_capture=True` when your runner must collect stdout even in passthrough
mode. If you need to branch on the current behavior, call
`tenzir_test.run.get_harness_mode()` or `tenzir_test.run.is_passthrough_enabled()`.

The harness cycles between three internal modes:

- `HarnessMode.COMPARE` – default behavior; compare actual output with stored baselines.
- `HarnessMode.UPDATE` – engaged when you pass `--update`; runners should overwrite reference files.
- `HarnessMode.PASSTHROUGH` – enabled via `-p/--passthrough`; stream output directly without touching baselines.

`get_harness_mode()` returns the current enum value so custom runners can adapt logic if needed.

## Configuration and frontmatter

`tenzir-test` merges configuration sources in this order (later wins):

1. Project defaults (`test.yaml` files, applied per directory).
2. Per-test frontmatter (YAML for `.tql`/`.xxd`, `# key: value` comments for
   Python and shell scripts).

Common frontmatter keys:

| Key            | Type            | Default   | Description                                                             |
| -------------- | --------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `runner`       | string          | by suffix | Runner name (`tenzir`, `python`, `shell`, custom).                      |
| `fixtures`     | list            | `[]`      | Requested fixtures. Accepts bare names and structured options mappings. |
| `timeout`      | integer (s)     | `30`      | Command timeout. (`--coverage` multiplies it by five.)                  |
| `error`        | boolean         | `false`   | Expect a non-zero exit code.                                            |
| `skip`         | string or dict  | unset     | Mark tests as skipped. See [skip configuration](#skip-configuration).   |
| `inputs`       | string          | project   | Override `TENZIR_INPUTS` for this directory or test.                    |
| `retry`        | integer         | `1`       | Total attempt budget for flaky tests (see below).                       |
| `package-dirs` | list of strings | inherit   | Directory-only; extra packages merged with CLI `--package-dirs`.        |

`test.yaml` files accept the same keys and apply recursively to child
directories. A relative `inputs:` value resolves against the file that defines
it, so `inputs: ../data` inside `tests/alerts/test.yaml` points at
`tests/data/`. Frontmatter values follow the same rule and win over directory
defaults. Adjacent `tenzir.yaml` files still configure the Tenzir binary; the
harness appends `--config=<file>` automatically. The lookup keeps working even
when you point the CLI at extra directories on the command line.

`retry` represents the **total number of attempts** the harness should make before
declaring the test failed. Intermediate attempts stay quiet; the final outcome
line includes `attempts=N/M` whenever the budget exceeds one. Keep the value
small and treat it as a temporary guardrail while you fix the underlying
flakiness.

### Skip configuration

The `skip` key supports two forms:

**String form** marks the test (or every test in the directory) as
unconditionally skipped. The value is the reason:

```yaml
skip: "pending upstream fix"
```

**Structured form** conditionally skips tests when a fixture signals that it
cannot provide its service. Use this when the suite depends on an external
resource that may not be available in every environment (for example a container
runtime):

```yaml
skip:
  on: fixture-unavailable
```

The only supported value for `on` is `fixture-unavailable`. When a fixture
raises `FixtureUnavailable` during initialization and the suite carries this
configuration, all tests in the suite are marked as skipped with exit code 0.
Without the opt-in configuration the exception propagates normally and causes a
test failure.

The optional `reason` field provides additional context that is combined with
the exception message in the skip output. See
[Fixture unavailability](#fixture-unavailability) for the fixture-side API.

### Tenzir configuration files

- The harness inspects the directory that owns each test. If it finds
  `tenzir.yaml`, it appends `--config=<path>` to every invocation of the
  bundled `tenzir`/`tql`/`diff` runners. The path also seeds `TENZIR_CONFIG`
  unless you set that variable yourself. Custom runners that call the Tenzir
  binary should either use `run.get_test_env_and_config_args(test)` or honour
  the exported environment variables explicitly.
- The built-in `node` fixture uses the same discovery process and starts
  `tenzir-node` from the directory that owns the test file, so relative paths
  inside `tenzir-node.yaml` resolve against the test location. See the
  [built-in node fixture](#built-in-node-fixture) section for precedence rules.
- This lets you keep one config for CLI-driven scenarios while passing a
  different config to the embedded node, for example to tweak endpoints or data
  directories independently.

## Fixtures

### Declaring fixtures

- List fixture names in frontmatter (`fixtures: [node, http]`). Entries can be
  bare strings or single-key mappings with structured options:

  ```yaml
  # Bare names (backward compatible)
  fixtures: [node, http]

  # With structured options
  fixtures:
    - node:
        tls: true
        port: 8443
    - http

  # Mixed form
  fixtures:
    - node:
        tls: true
    - http
  ```

  Importing the project `fixtures` package is enough to register custom fixtures
  thanks to the side effects in `fixtures/__init__.py`.

- The harness encodes requests in `TENZIR_TEST_FIXTURES` and exposes helper APIs
  in `tenzir_test.fixtures`:
  - `fixtures()` – Read-only view of active fixtures. Attribute access is
    supported, e.g. `fixtures().node` returns `True` if the fixture was
    requested and raises `AttributeError` otherwise.
  - `acquire_fixture("name")` – Manual controller for the named fixture. Use it
    as a context manager for automatic `start()`/`stop()` or call those methods
    explicitly to interleave lifecycle steps and optional hooks (for example
    `kill()` or `restart()`).
  - `require("name")` – Assert that a fixture was requested.
  - `Executor()` – Convenience wrapper that runs Tenzir commands with resolved
    binaries and timeout budget.

Example use from a Python helper:

```python
from tenzir_test.fixtures import Executor

executor = Executor()
result = executor.run("from_file 'inputs/events.ndjson' | where severity >= 5\n")
assert result.returncode == 0
```

### Built-in node fixture

- Request the fixture with `fixtures: [node]`; the harness will start
  `tenzir-node` with the binaries discovered for the current test.
- Configuration precedence:
  1. `TENZIR_NODE_CONFIG` in the environment.
  2. A `tenzir-node.yaml` placed next to the test file (exported
     automatically).
  3. The Tenzir defaults (no config file).
- The node process inherits the test directory as its current working
  directory, letting `tenzir-node.yaml` reference files with relative paths
  (for example `state/` or `schemas/`).
- Each controller reuses its state and cache directories across
  `start()`/`stop()` cycles. By default they live under the per-test scratch
  directory (`TENZIR_TMP_DIR/tenzir-node-*`) and are removed once the fixture
  context ends. Starting a fresh controller (for example in another test run)
  yields a brand-new workspace.
- The fixture reuses other inherited arguments (for example
  `--package-dirs=…`) but replaces any existing `--config=` flag so the node
  process always honours the chosen configuration file.
- Tests can read `TENZIR_NODE_CLIENT_ENDPOINT`,
  `TENZIR_NODE_CLIENT_BINARY`, `TENZIR_NODE_CLIENT_TIMEOUT`,
  `TENZIR_NODE_STATE_DIRECTORY`, and `TENZIR_NODE_CACHE_DIRECTORY` from the
  environment to connect to the spawned node and inspect its working tree.
- Pipelines launched by the bundled Tenzir runners automatically receive
  `--endpoint=<value>` when this fixture is active, so they talk to the
  transient node without additional wiring.
- CLI and node configuration are independent: configure the CLI with
  `tenzir.yaml` and drop a `tenzir-node.yaml` (or set `TENZIR_NODE_CONFIG`) only
  when the node needs custom settings.
- When `tenzir-node` fails to start, the fixture reports the exit code and
  stderr output, making it easier to diagnose startup failures.

### Registering fixtures

Implement fixtures in `fixtures/` and register them with `@tenzir_test.fixture()`.
Decorate a generator function, yield the environment mapping, and handle cleanup
in a `finally` block:

```python
from tenzir_test import fixture


@fixture()
def http():
    server = _start_server()
    try:
        yield {"HTTP_FIXTURE_URL": server.url}
    finally:
        server.stop()
```

`@fixture` also accepts regular callables returning dictionaries, context
managers, or `FixtureHandle` instances for advanced scenarios.

The [fixture guide](/guides/testing/create-fixtures) demonstrates an HTTP echo
server that exposes `HTTP_FIXTURE_URL` and tears down cleanly.

### Fixture options

Fixtures can declare a frozen dataclass via `options=` on `@fixture()`. The
harness constructs a typed instance from frontmatter values and makes it
available through `current_options()`:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class HttpOptions:
    port: int = 0

@fixture(options=HttpOptions)
def http() -> Iterator[dict[str, str]]:
    opts = current_options("http")  # HttpOptions instance
    ...
```

```yaml
fixtures:
  - http:
      port: 9090
```

Bare names (`fixtures: [http]`) produce the dataclass defaults. Option fields
can themselves be dataclasses; the harness instantiates nested types
recursively. Use `Optional[T]` or `T | None` for nested fields that may be
absent. The `register()` function accepts the same `options` parameter for
programmatic registration.

See the [fixture guide](/guides/testing/create-fixtures) for a complete
walkthrough including nested options and optional fields.

### Fixture unavailability

Fixtures can signal that they cannot provide their service by raising
`FixtureUnavailable` during initialization (before yielding). This is useful
when a fixture depends on an external tool or runtime that may not be present
in every environment.

```python
from tenzir_test.fixtures import FixtureUnavailable, fixture


@fixture()
def mysql():
    if not shutil.which("docker"):
        raise FixtureUnavailable("docker not found")
    # ... start container, yield env, cleanup ...
```

By default the exception propagates and causes a test failure. To convert it
into a skip, add a structured `skip` entry to the suite's `test.yaml`:

```yaml
# tests/mysql/test.yaml
suite: mysql-integration
fixtures: [mysql]
skip:
  on: fixture-unavailable
  reason: "needs container runtime"
```

When the fixture raises `FixtureUnavailable` and the suite carries this
configuration, the harness marks every test in the suite as skipped (exit
code 0) and logs the combined reason. Without the opt-in configuration the
exception surfaces as a regular failure. See
[skip configuration](#skip-configuration) for the full syntax of the `skip`
key.

## Environment variables

`tenzir-test` recognises the following environment variables:

- `TENZIR_TEST_ROOT` – Default test root when `--root` is omitted.
- `TENZIR_BINARY` / `TENZIR_NODE_BINARY` – Override binary auto-detection.
  Supports multi-part commands like `TENZIR_BINARY="uvx tenzir"` or
  `TENZIR_NODE_BINARY="docker exec container tenzir-node"`.
- `TENZIR_INPUTS` – Preferred data directory. Defaults to the nearest `inputs/`
  directory walking up from the test, falling back to the project-level inputs
  folder. Reflects any `inputs:` override from `test.yaml` or frontmatter.
- `TENZIR_INPUT` – Path to the inline input file when a `.input` file exists
  next to the test. Not set otherwise.
- `TENZIR_STDIN` – Path to the stdin file when a `.stdin` file exists next to
  the test. The harness pipes this file's content to the subprocess stdin. Not
  set otherwise.
- `TENZIR_KEEP_TMP_DIRS` – Keep per-test scratch directories (equivalent to
  `--keep`).
- `TENZIR_TEST_DEBUG` – Enable debug logging and verbose output (equivalent to
  `--debug`).

### Binary resolution

The harness automatically detects `tenzir` and `tenzir-node` binaries using this
precedence:

1. `TENZIR_BINARY` / `TENZIR_NODE_BINARY` environment variable (highest priority)
2. Local installation found via `PATH` lookup (`shutil.which`)
3. Fallback to `uvx tenzir` / `uvx --from tenzir tenzir-node` when `uv` is installed

Most users can run `tenzir-test` without any configuration. When `uv` is
installed, the harness automatically uses `uvx` to fetch and run Tenzir on
demand.

Environment variables support multi-part commands, allowing invocations like
`TENZIR_BINARY="uvx tenzir"` or `TENZIR_BINARY="docker exec node tenzir"`. The
harness splits these values into argument lists using shell tokenization rules.

Fixtures often publish additional variables (for example
`TENZIR_NODE_CLIENT_*`, `TENZIR_NODE_STATE_DIRECTORY`,
`TENZIR_NODE_CACHE_DIRECTORY`, `HTTP_FIXTURE_URL`).

During execution the harness also adds transient variables such as
`TENZIR_TMP_DIR` so tests and fixtures can create temporary artifacts without
polluting the repository. Combine it with `--keep` (or
`TENZIR_KEEP_TMP_DIRS=1`) when you need to inspect the generated files after a
run.

## Baselines and artifacts

Regenerate reference output whenever behavior changes intentionally:

```sh
uvx tenzir-test --update
```

`--purge` removes stale artifacts (diffs, temporary files). Keep generated
`.txt` files under version control so future runs can diff against them.

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing binaries** – The harness auto-detects binaries on `PATH` and falls
  back to `uvx tenzir` when `uv` is installed. If neither is available, set the
  `TENZIR_BINARY` and `TENZIR_NODE_BINARY` environment variables to point at
  your installation.
- **Unexpected exits** – Set `error: true` in frontmatter when a non-zero exit is
  expected.
- **Skipped tests** – Use `skip: reason` to document temporary skips; baseline
  files can stay empty. For fixture-dependent suites, use the structured
  `skip: {on: fixture-unavailable}` form so tests skip gracefully when a
  required tool is missing.
- **Noisy output** – Use `--jobs 1` to serialize worker logs, and enable
  `--debug` (or set `TENZIR_TEST_DEBUG=1`) when you need to trace comparisons
  and fixture activity. Note that `--debug` automatically enables verbose
  output.
