This workflow guides you through creating a package to parse and clean log
events. To this end, you scaffold a Tenzir package and build user-defined
operators.

Follow the steps in order.

## Understand your data

Start with a deep understanding of the sample data given.

**Resources**:

- Internet: search for extra samples to better understand product and vendor.

**Results**:

- Context around the given samples
- Name of the vendor and product for the package

## Create the package scaffold

Set up the directory structure and manifest file for your package.

**Resources**:

- <Guide>packages/create-a-package</Guide>

**Results**:

- A package for vendor `acme`
- A package manifest: `acme/package.yaml`
- Event samples in `acme/tests/inputs`

## Add operators

Create user-defined operators for parsing and cleaning. Use the testing
framework to validate each step of work.

**Resources**:

- <Guide>packages/add-operators</Guide>
- <Guide>packages/test-packages</Guide>

**Results**:

- An operator `acme::product::parse`
   - Tests in `acme/tests/product/parse/*.tql`
- An operator `acme::product::clean`
   - Tests in `acme/tests/product/clean/*.tql`

### Parsing operator

The parsing operator translates unstructured into structured data. This is only
needed when the data is not yet parsed, i.e., a raw string, or when it contains
fields that are not yet parsed, e.g., a JSON with `payload` field.

**Resources**:

- <Guide>packages/create-a-package</Guide>
- <Guide>parsing/parse-delimited-text</Guide>
- <Guide>parsing/parse-string-fields</Guide>

### Cleaning operator

The cleaning operator ensures semantically rich types, replaces sentinel values,
and ensure a proper schema when possible.

**Resources**:

- <Guide>normalization/clean-up-values</Guide>
- <Guide>transformation/work-with-time</Guide>
