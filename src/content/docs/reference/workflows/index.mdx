This section contains workflow prompts that AI agents execute directly. Each
workflow is a verbatim prompt with phased instructions.

## Generate a Parser Package

Create a TQL parsing pipeline from sample logs. Given raw log data, this
workflow guides you through input analysis, package scaffolding, iterative
parsing refinement, and test coverage.

operator, and validate against the schema.
