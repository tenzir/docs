This section contains workflow prompts that AI agents execute directly. Each
workflow is a verbatim prompt with phased instructions.

## Generate a Parser Package

Create a TQL parsing pipeline from sample logs. Given raw log data, this
workflow guides you through input analysis, package scaffolding, iterative
parsing refinement, and test coverage.

## Generate an OCSF Mapping

Add OCSF mapping to a parser package. Starting from parsed data, this workflow
helps you identify the appropriate OCSF event class, create the mapping
operator, and validate against the schema.
