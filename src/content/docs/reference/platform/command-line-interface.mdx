The Tenzir Platform command-line interface (CLI) allows you to interact with
the Tenzir Platform from the command line to manage workspaces and nodes.

## Installation

Install the [`tenzir-platform`](https://pypi.org/project/tenzir-platform/)
package from PyPI.

```text
pip install tenzir-platform
```

## Environment Variable Configuration

The Tenzir Platform CLI supports several environment variables to configure
authentication and platform connection settings. All configuration variables
for the CLI share the prefix `TENZIR_PLATFORM_CLI_`.

### Supported Settings

- `TENZIR_PLATFORM_CLI_API_ENDPOINT`: The URL of the Tenzir Platform API
  instance to connect to. Defaults to `https://rest.tenzir.app/production-v1`.

- `TENZIR_PLATFORM_CLI_EXTRA_HEADERS`: Additional headers that the CLI should send
  with any request to the Tenzir Platform. Must provide as a JSON object.

- `TENZIR_PLATFORM_CLI_ISSUER_URL`: The OIDC issuer URL for authentication.
  Defaults to the issuer URL that the public Tenzir Platform instance uses at
  https://app.tenzir.com.

- `TENZIR_PLATFORM_CLI_CLIENT_ID`: The client ID for the CLI client.
  Defaults to the client id that the public Tenzir Platform instance uses at
  https://app.tenzir.com.

- `TENZIR_PLATFORM_CLI_CLIENT_SECRET`: The client secret for the CLI client.
  When set, the CLI automatically attempts to use the client credentials flow
  instead of the device code flow for authentication.

- `TENZIR_PLATFORM_CLI_CLIENT_SECRET_FILE`: Path to a file containing the
  client secret. Alternative to providing the secret directly via
  `TENZIR_PLATFORM_CLI_CLIENT_SECRET`.

- `TENZIR_PLATFORM_CLI_ID_TOKEN`: If provided, skip the login workflow
  completely and use this token for authentication.

## Authentication

### Synopsis

```text
tenzir-platform auth login
tenzir-platform workspace list
tenzir-platform workspace select <workspace_id>
```

### Description

The `tenzir-platform auth login` command authenticates you with the platform.

The `tenzir-platform workspace list` command shows all workspaces available to
you. The `tenzir-platform workspace select` command selects a workspace for
subsequent operations.

#### `<workspace_id>`

The unique ID of the workspace, as shown in `tenzir-platform workspace list`.

## Manage Nodes

### Synopsis

```text
tenzir-platform node list
tenzir-platform node ping <node_id>
tenzir-platform node create [--name <node_name>]
tenzir-platform node delete <node_id>
tenzir-platform node run [--name <node_name>] [--image <container_image>]
```

### Description

The following commands interact with the selected workspace:

- `tenzir-platform node list` lists all nodes in the selected workspace,
  including their ID, name, and connection status.
- `tenzir-platform node ping` pings the specified node.
- `tenzir-platform node create` registers a new node at the platform. This
  command creates a new API key that a node can use to connect to the platform.
  It does not start or configure a node.
- `tenzir-platform node delete` removes a node from the platform. This command
  does not stop the node; it only removes it from the platform.
- `tenzir-platform node run` creates and registers an ad-hoc node, then starts
  it on the local host. This command requires Docker Compose. The platform
  deletes the temporary node when you stop the `run` command.

#### `<node_id>`

The unique ID of the node, as shown in `tenzir-platform node list`.

#### `<node_name>`

The name of the node as shown in the app.

#### `<container_image>`

The Docker image to use for the ad-hoc created node. We recommend using one of
the following images:

- `tenzir/tenzir:latest` to use the latest release.
- `tenzir/tenzir:main` to use the current development version.
- `tenzir/tenzir:v5` to pin to a major release.
- `tenzir/tenzir:v5.1` to pin to a minor release.
- `tenzir/tenzir:v5.1.3` to use a specific release.

## Manage Secrets

The Tenzir Platform provides secret storage that pipelines running on a Tenzir
node can access.

### Synopsis

```text
tenzir-platform secret add <name> [--file=<file>] [--value=<value>] [--env]
tenzir-platform secret update <secret_id> [--file=<file>] [--value=<value>] [--env]
tenzir-platform secret delete <secret_id>
tenzir-platform secret list [--json]
```

### Description

The following commands manage secrets in the Tenzir Platform:

- `tenzir-platform secret add` adds a new secret to the platform. You can
  provide the secret value directly via the `--value` option, read it from a
  file using the `--file` option, or source it from an environment variable
  using the `--env` flag. The platform identifies the secret by the provided
  `<name>`.

- `tenzir-platform secret update` updates an existing secret identified by
  `<secret_id>`. Like adding a secret, you can provide the new value via
  `--value`, `--file`, or `--env`.

- `tenzir-platform secret delete` removes a secret from the platform. The
  command identifies the secret to delete by its `<secret_id>`.

- `tenzir-platform secret list` lists all secrets available in the platform.
  Use the `--json` flag to output the list in JSON format for easier
  integration with other tools.

#### `<name>`

The unique name to identify the secret. Pipelines use this name when they access
the secret.

#### `<secret_id>`

The unique identifier of the secret, as shown in the output of
`tenzir-platform secret list`.

#### `--file=<file>`

Specifies a file containing the secret value. The platform securely stores the
file's contents as the secret value.

#### `--value=<value>`

Specifies the secret value directly as a command-line argument.

#### `--env`

Indicates that the command should source the secret value from an environment
variable. You must set the environment variable before you run the command.

#### `--json`

Outputs the list of secrets in JSON format when used with the
`tenzir-platform secret list` command.

## Manage external secret stores

You can configure workspaces to use external secret stores instead of the
Tenzir Platform's built-in secret store.

Currently, the platform only supports
[AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/) as an external
store.

By default, the platform mounts external secret stores as read-only. You can't
add or update secrets from the CLI or web interface. Some external secret store
implementations may offer write access options.

### Synopsis

```text
tenzir-platform secret store add aws
    --region=<region>
    --assumed-role-arn=<assumed_role_arn>
    [--name=<name>]
    [--prefix=<prefix>]
    [--access-key-id=<key_id>]
    [--secret-access-key=<key>]
tenzir-platform secret store set-default <store_id>
tenzir-platform secret store delete <store_id>
tenzir-platform secret store list [--json]
```

### Description

When a node accesses a secret using the `secret("foo")` function in a pipeline,
the platform looks up the secret named `foo` in the workspace's default secret
store and returns the value to the node.

When using an external secret store, the platform needs the necessary
permissions to read secret values from that store.

For AWS Secrets Manager, the Tenzir Platform uses [AWS Security Token Service
(STS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/welcome.html) to
assume a role with the necessary permissions. You must create this role and
configure one of the following options:

1. Create an IAM user. Download access keys and pass them via the
   `--access-key-id` and `--secret-access-key` arguments. This approach is the
   easiest to set up but only acceptable for self-hosted testing or development
   instances of the Tenzir Platform because it stores long-term credentials in
   the Tenzir Platform.

2. Assign the permissions to the task role of the websocket gateway. We
   recommend this option if you're running the Sovereign Edition of the
   Platform and deploying it to your own AWS account.

3. Assign the permission to assume the configured role to Tenzir's AWS account
   with the ID `660178929208`. This option works only with our publicly hosted
   platform instance on `https://app.tenzir.com`.

We plan to add an OIDC-based option as an alternative to options 1 and 3.

## Manage Alerts

### Synopsis

```text
tenzir-platform alert add <node> <duration> <webhook_url> [<webhook_body>]
tenzir-platform alert delete <alert_id>
tenzir-platform alert list
```

### Description

The following commands set up alerts for specific nodes. When a
node remains disconnected for the configured duration, the alert triggers by
sending a POST request to the configured webhook URL.

#### `<node>`

The node to monitor. You can provide either a node ID or a node name, as long
as the name is unambiguous.

#### `<duration>`

The amount of time to wait between the node disconnect and triggering the alert.

#### `<webhook_url>`

The platform sends a POST request to this URL when the alert triggers.

#### `<webhook_body>`

The body to send with the webhook. Must be valid JSON. The body may contain
`$NODE_NAME`, which the platform replaces with the name of the node that
triggered the alert.

Defaults to `{"text": "Node $NODE_NAME disconnected for more than {duration}s"}`,
where the platform sets `$NODE_NAME` and `{duration}` dynamically from the CLI
parameters.

### Example

Consider nodes like this:

```text
$ tenzir-platform node list
ðŸŸ¢ Node-1 (n-w2tjezz3)
ðŸŸ¢ Node-2 (n-kzw21299)
ðŸ”´ Node-3 (n-ie2tdgca)
```

We want to receive a Slack notification whenever Node-3 is offline for more
than three minutes. First, we create a webhook as described in the
[Slack docs](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks). Next, we configure the
alert in the Tenzir Platform:

```text
tenzir-platform alert add Node-3 3m "https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXX/YYYYY/ZZZZZ" '{"text": "Alert! Look after node $NODE_NAME"}'
```

If Node-3 doesn't reconnect within three minutes, a message appears in the
configured Slack channel.

## Manage workspaces

:::caution[On-premise setup required]
This CLI functionality requires an on-premise platform deployment, available
with the [Sovereign Edition](https://tenzir.com/pricing).
:::

These CLI commands are available only to local platform administrators. The
[`TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_ADMIN_RULES` variable](/guides/platform-setup/configure-identity-provider)
defines who's an administrator in your platform deployment.

### Synopsis

```text
tenzir-platform admin list-global-workspaces
tenzir-platform admin create-workspace <owner_namespace> <owner_id> [--name <workspace_name>]
tenzir-platform admin delete-workspace <workspace_id>
```

### Description

The `tenzir-platform admin list-global-workspaces`, `tenzir-platform
admin create-workspace`, and `tenzir-platform admin delete-workspace` commands
list, create, or delete workspaces, respectively.

#### `<owner_namespace>`

Either `user` or `organization`, depending on whether the workspace associates
with a user or an organization.

The selected namespace determines the _default_ access rules for the workspace:

- For a user workspace, the platform creates a single access rule that allows
  access to the user whose user ID matches the given `owner_id`.
- For an organization workspace, the platform creates no rules by default. You
  must manually add them using the `add-auth-rule` subcommand described below.

#### `<owner_id>`

The unique ID of the workspace owner:

- If `<owner_namespace>` is `user`, this matches the user's `sub` claim in the
  OIDC token.
- If `<owner_namespace>` is `organization`, this is an arbitrary string that
  uniquely identifies the organization the workspace belongs to.

#### `--name <workspace_name>`

The name of the workspace as shown in the app.

#### `<workspace_id>`

The unique ID of the workspace, as shown in `tenzir-platform workspace list` or
`tenzir-platform admin list-global-workspaces`.

## Configure access rules

:::caution[On-premise setup required]
You can use this CLI functionality only with an on-premise platform deployment,
which is available to users of the
[Sovereign Edition](https://tenzir.com/pricing).
:::

These CLI commands are available only to local platform administrators. The
[`TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_ADMIN_RULES` variable](/guides/platform-setup/configure-identity-provider)
defines who's an administrator in your platform deployment.

### Synopsis

```text
tenzir-platform admin list-auth-rules <workspace_id>

tenzir-platform admin add-auth-rule allow-all <workspace_id>
tenzir-platform admin add-auth-rule user <workspace_id> <user_id>
tenzir-platform admin add-auth-rule
    email-domain <workspace_id> <connection> <domain>
tenzir-platform admin add-auth-rule
    organization-membership <workspace_id> <connection> <organization_claim> <organization>
tenzir-platform admin add-auth-rule
    organization-role <workspace_id> <connection> <roles_claim> <role> <organization_claim> <organization>

tenzir-platform admin delete-auth-rule <workspace_id> <auth_rule_index>
```

### Description

You can use the `tenzir-platform admin list-auth-rules`,
`tenzir-platform admin add-auth-rule`, and `tenzir-platform admin delete-auth-rule`
commands to list, create, or delete authentication rules for all users,
respectively, if you have admin permissions.

Authentication rules allow you to access the workspace with the provided
`<workspace_id>` if your `id_token` matches the configured rule. You
gain access to a workspace if any configured rule allows access. The following
rules exist:

- **Email Suffix Rule**: `tenzir-platform admin add-auth-rule email-domain`
  allows access if the `id_token` contains a `connection` field that exactly
  matches the provided `<connection>` and an `email` field that ends with the
  configured `<domain>`.

- **Organization Membership**: `tenzir-platform admin add-auth-rule organization-membership`
  allows access if the `id_token` contains a `connection`
  field that exactly matches the provided `<connection>` and an
  `<organization_claim>` field that exactly matches the provided `<organization>`.

  Note that you can freely choose the `<organization_claim>` and
  `<organization>`, so you can also repurpose this rule for generic claims that
  are not necessarily related to organizations.

- **Organization Role Rule**: `tenzir-platform admin add-auth-rule
organization-role` allows access if the `id_token` contains a `connection`
  field that exactly matches the provided `<connection>`, an
  `<organization_claim>` field that exactly matches the provided
  `<organization>`, and a `<roles_claim>` field that must be a list containing
  a value exactly matching `<role>`.

  We recommend using organization role rules to check if you have a specific
  role with an organization.

- **User Rule**: `tenzir-platform admin add-auth-rule user` allows access if
  the `id_token` contains a `sub` field that exactly matches the provided
  `<user_id>`.

- **Allow all rule**: `tenzir-platform admin add-auth-rule allow-all` allows
  access to every user. Use this rule to set up a workspace that all users of a
  platform instance can access.
