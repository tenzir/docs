title: Statements
---

TQL programs are structured as a sequence of operators that perform various
functions on data streams. Each operator can be thought of as a modular unit
that processes data and can be combined with other operators to create complex
workflows.

## Operator

Operator statements consist of the operator name, followed by an arbitrary
number of arguments. Arguments are delimited by commas and may optionally be
enclosed in parentheses. If the last argument is a pipeline expression, the
preceding comma can be omitted for brevity.

Arguments can be specified in two ways: they can be positional, where the order
matters, or named, where each argument is explicitly associated with a parameter
name. Furthermore, arguments can be classified as required or optional. Some
operators expect constant values, while others are designed to accept runtime
values.

```tql
select foo, bar.baz
drop qux
head 42
sort abs(x)
```

## Assignment

An assignment statement in TQL is structured as `<place> = <expression>`, where
`<place>` typically refers to a field or item of a list. If the specified place
already exists, the assignment will overwrite its current value. If it does not
exist, a new field will be created.

The `<place>` can also reference a field path. For example, the statement
`foo.bar = 42` assigns the value 42 to the field `bar` within the record `foo`.
If `foo` is not a record or does not exist before, it will be set to a record
containing just the field `bar`.

```tql
category_name = "Network Activity"
type_uid = class_uid * 100 + activity_id
traffic.bytes_out = event.sent_bytes
```

## `if`

The `if` statement is a primitive designed to route data based on a predicate.
Its typical usage follows the syntax `if <expression> { … } else { … }`, where
two subpipelines are specified within the braces. When its expression evaluates
to `true`, the first pipeline processes the event. Conversely, when it evaluates
to `false`, it is routed through the second one.

After the `if` statement the event flow from both pipelines is joined together.
The `else` clause can be omitted, resulting in the syntax `if <expression> { …
}`, which has the same behavior as `if <expression> { … } else {}`.
Additionally, the `else` keyword can be followed by another `if` statement,
allowing for chained `if` statements. This chaining can be repeated, enabling
complex conditional logic to be implemented.

```tql
if score < 100 {
  severity = "low"
  drop details
} else if score < 200 {
  severity = "medium"
} else {
  severity = "high"
}
```

## `let`

The `let` statement binds a constant to a specific name within the pipeline's
scope. The syntax for a `let` statement is `let $<identifier> = <expression>`.
For instance, `let $meaning = 42` creates a constant `$meaning` that holds the
value 42.

More complex expressions can also be assigned, such as `let $start = now() -
1h`, which binds `$start` to a value representing one hour before the pipeline
was started. Constants defined with `let` can be referenced in subsequent
statements, including other `let` statements. For example, `let $end = $start +
30min` can be used to define `$end` depending on the value of `$start`.

```tql
let $meaning = 42
let $start = now() - 1h
let $end = $start + 30min
```
