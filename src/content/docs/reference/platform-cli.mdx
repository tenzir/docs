title: Platform CLI
---

The *Tenzir Platform CLI* allows users to interact with the *Tenzir Platform*
from the command-line to manage their workspaces and nodes.

## Installation

Install the [`tenzir-platform`](https://pypi.org/project/tenzir-platform/)
package from PyPI.

```sh
pip install tenzir-platform
```

## Authentication

### Synopsis

```
tenzir-platform auth login
tenzir-platform workspace list
tenzir-platform workspace select <workspace_id>
```

### Description

The `tenzir-platform auth login` command authenticates the current user.

The `tenzir-platform workspace list` and `tenzir-platform workspace select`
commands show workspaces available to the authenticated user and select one,
respectively.

#### `<workspace_id>`

The unique ID of the workspace, as shown in `tenzir-platform workspace list`.

## Manage Nodes

### Synopsis

```
tenzir-platform node list
tenzir-platform node ping <node_id>
tenzir-platform node create [--name <node_name>]
tenzir-platform node delete <node_id>
tenzir-platform node run [--name <node_name>] [--image <container_image>]
```

### Description

The following commands interact with the selected workspace. See
[Authentication](#authentication) above for how to select a workspace:

- `tenzir-platform node list` lists all nodes in the selected workspace,
  including their ID, name, and connection status.
- `tenzir-platform node ping` pings the specified node.
- `tenzir-platform node create` registers a new node at the platform so that it
  can be connected to the platform. Note that this neither starts a new node nor
  configures one, it just creates a new API key that a node can use to connect
  to the platform with.
- `tenzir-platform node delete` removes a node from the platform. Note that this
  does not stop the node, it just removes it from the platform.
- `tenzir-platform node run` creates and registers an ad-hoc node, and starts it
  on the local host. Requires Docker Compose to be available.
  The node is temporary and will be deleted when the `run` command is stopped.

#### `<node_id>`

The unique ID of the node, as shown in `tenzir-platform node list`.

#### `<node_name>`

The name of the node as shown in the app.

#### `<container_image>`

The Docker image to use for ad-hoc created node. We recommend using one of the
following images:

- `tenzir/tenzir:v4.11.2` to use the specified release.
- `tenzir/tenzir:latest` to use the last release.
- `tenzir/tenzir:main` to use the currnet development version.

## Manage Alerts

### Synopsis

```
tenzir-platform alert add <node> <duration> <webhook_url> [<webhook_body>]
tenzir-platform alert delete <alert_id>
tenzir-platform alert list
```

### Description

The following commands allow for setting up alerts for specific nodes. After a
node has been disconnected for the configured amount of time, an alert fires by
performing a POST request against the configured webhook URL.

#### `<node>`

The node to be monitored. Can be given provided as a node ID or a node name,
as long as the name is unambiguous.

#### `<duration>`

The amount of time to wait between the node disconnect and triggering the alert.

#### `<webhook_url>`

The platform performs a POST request against this URL when the alert triggers.

#### `<webhook_body>`

The body to send along with the webhook. Must be valid JSON. The body may
contain the string `$NODE_NAME`, which will be replaced by the name of the
node that triggered the alert.

Defaults to `{"text": "Node $NODE_NAME disconnected for more than {duration}s"}`,
where `node_id` and `duration` are set dynamically from the CLI parameters.

### Example

Given nodes like this:

```sh
tenzir-platform node list
ðŸŸ¢ Node-1 (n-w2tjezz3)
ðŸŸ¢ Node-2 (n-kzw21299)
ðŸ”´ Node-3 (n-ie2tdgca)
```

Assume that we want to receive a Slack notification whenever Node-3 is offline
for more than 3 minutes. First create a webhook as described in the [Slack
docs](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks). Next, configure the alert in
the Tenzir Platform:

```sh
tenzir-platform alert add Node-3 3m \
  "https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXX/YYYYY/ZZZZZ" '{"text": "Alert! Look after node $NODE_NAME"}'
```

Unless Node-3 reconnects, we should see a message appear after 3 minutes in the
configured Slack channel.

## Manage Workspaces

:::caution[On-premise setup required]
This functionality of the CLI can only be used in combination
with an on-premise platform deployment, which is available to users
of the [Sovereign Edition](https://tenzir.com/pricing).
:::

These CLI commands are only available to local platform administrators.
The `TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_ADMIN_RULES` variable described
[here](installation/deploy-the-platform#identity-provider-idp) is used
to define who is an administrator in your platform deployment.

### Synopsis

```
tenzir-platform admin list-global-workspaces
tenzir-platform admin create-workspace <owner_namespace> <owner_id> [--name <workspace_name>]
tenzir-platform admin delete-workspace <workspace_id>
```

### Description

The `tenzir-platform workspace admin list-global-workspaces`, `tenzir-platform
admin create-workspace`, and `tenzir-platform admin delete-workspace` commands
list, create, or delete workspaces, respectively.

#### `<owner_namespace>`

Either `user` or `organization`, depending on whether the workspace is
associated with a user or an organization.

The selected namespace will determine the *default* access rules for the
workspace:

 - For a user workspace, a single access rule will be created that allows
   access to the user whose user id matches the given `owner_id`
 - For an organization workspace, no rules will be created by default and
   they have to be manually added using the `add-auth-rule` subcommand
   described below.

#### `<owner_id>`

The unique ID of the workspace owner:

- If `<owner_namespace>` is `user`, then this matches the user's `sub` claim in
  the OIDC token.
- If `<owner_namespace>` is `organization`, then this is an arbitrary string
  uniquely identifiying the organization the workspace belongs to.

#### `--name <workspace_name>`

The name of the workspace as shown in the app.

#### `<workspace_id>`

The unique ID of the workspace, as shown in `tenzir-platform workspace list` or
`tenzir-platform admin list-global-workspaces`.

## Configure Access Rules

:::caution[On-premise setup required]

with an on-premise platform deployment, which is available to users
of the [Sovereign Edition](https://tenzir.com/pricing).
:::

These CLI commands are only available to local platform administrators.
The `TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_ADMIN_RULES` variable described
[here](installation/deploy-the-platform#identity-provider-idp) is used
to define who is an administrator in your platform deployment.

### Synopsis

```
tenzir-platform admin list-auth-rules <workspace_id>
tenzir-platform admin add-auth-rule [--dry-run]
    email-domain <workspace_id> <connection> <domain>
tenzir-platform admin add-auth-rule [--dry-run]
    organization-membership <workspace_id> <connection> <organization_claim> <organization>
tenzir-platform admin add-auth-rule [--dry-run]
    organization-role <workspace_id> <connection> <roles_claim> <role> <organization_claim> <organization>
tenzir-platform admin add-auth-rule [--dry-run]
    user <workspace_id> <user_id>
  tenzir-platform admin add-auth-rule [--dry-run]
    allow-all <workspace_id>
tenzir-platform admin delete-auth-rule <workspace_id> <auth_rule_index>
```

### Description

Users with admin permissions can additionally use the `tenzir-platform admin
list-auth-rules`, `tenzir-platform admin add-auth-rule`, and `tenzir-platform
admin delete-auth-rule` commands to list, create, or delete authentication rules
for all users, respectively.

Authentication rules allow users to access the workspace with the provided
`<workspace_id>` if the user's `id_token` matches the configured rule. Users
have access to a workspace if any configured rule allows access. The following
rules exist:

- **Email Suffix Rule**: `tenzir-platform admin add-auth-rule email-domain`
  allows access if the `id_token` contains a field `connection` that exactly
  matches the provided `<connection>` and a field `email` that ends with the
  configured `<domain>`.

- **Organization Membership**: `tenzir-platform admin add-auth-rule
  organization-membership` allows
  access if the `id_token` contains a field `connection` that exactly matches the
  provided `<connection>` and a field `<organization_claim>` that exactly matches
  the provided `<organization>`.

  Note that the `<organization_claim>` and `<organization>` can be freely
  chosen, so this rule can also be repurposed for generic claims that are not
  necessarily related to organizations.

- **Organization Role Rule**: `tenzir-platform admin add-auth-rule
  organization-role` allows access if the `id_token` contains a field
  `connection` that exactly matches the provided `<connection>`, a field
  `<organization_claim>` that exactly matches the provided `<organization>`, and
  a field `<roles_claim>` that must be a list containing a value exactly
  matching `<role>`.

  We recommend using organization role rules to check if a user has a specific
  role with an organization.

- **User Rule**: `tenzir-platform admin add-auth-rule user` allows access if the
  `id_token` contains a field `sub` that exactly matches the provided
  `<user_id>`.

- **Allow All Rule**: `tenzir-platform admin add-auth-rule allow-all` allows
  access to every user. This can be useful to e.g. set up a workspace that is
  shared by all users of a platform instance.
