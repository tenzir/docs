title: Changelog Framework
---

The [`tenzir-changelog`](https://github.com/tenzir/changelog) harness curates
changelog entries, ships release notes, and assembles the public changelog
across Tenzir repositories. Use this page as a reference for concepts,
configuration, and CLI details. For step-by-step walkthroughs, see the guide for
[maintaining a changelog](/guides/package-management/maintain-a-changelog).

## Install

`tenzir-changelog` ships as a Python package that requires Python 3.12 or later.
Install it with [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (or `pip`) and verify the
console script:

```sh
uv add tenzir-changelog
uvx tenzir-changelog --help
```

## Python API

Drive the CLI flows from another Python process by importing the
`Changelog` helper:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from tenzir_changelog import Changelog

client = Changelog(root=Path("changelog"))
client.add(
    title="API entry",
    entry_type="feature",
    description="Body text",
    co_authors=["claude"],
)
client.show(identifiers=["unreleased"], view="markdown", explicit_links=True)
client.release_notes("v1.0.0", explicit_links=True)

# Get the latest version
version = client.release_version()  # Returns "v1.0.0"
bare_version = client.release_version(bare=True)  # Returns "1.0.0"

# Publish defaults to latest release
client.release_publish(create_tag=True, assume_yes=True)
```

For advanced scenarios, reuse `tenzir_changelog.create_cli_context` and call
the helper functions from `tenzir_changelog.cli` directly.

## Core concepts

- **Project** – Identifies which documentation stream the changelog belongs to.
  Every entry and release references the same project string.
- **Entry** – A changelog consists of entries. Each entry uses one of four
  hard-coded types: `breaking`, `feature`, `bugfix`, or `change`.
- **Unreleased bucket** – Pending entries live in `unreleased/` until you move
  them to a release.
- **Release** – Versioned milestone under `releases/<version>/` containing
  `manifest.yaml`, `notes.md`, and archived entry files in `entries/`.
- **Configuration file** – Settings live in `config.yaml` by default, or you can
  store them in `package.yaml` alongside the `changelog/` directory.
  `config.yaml` takes precedence when both exist.
- **Export style** – Controls whether release notes use a detailed card layout
  or a compact bullet-list layout. Set `export_style: compact` in configuration
  to prefer the bullet-list format without passing `--compact` each time.
- **Components** – You may constrain the optional `component` field on entries
  by declaring allowed labels in configuration. Use a dict mapping component
  names to descriptions. Component filters apply to the CLI table, exports, and
  validation.
- **Modules** – Independent changelog projects discovered via a glob pattern.
  Each module has its own configuration and versioning. The parent project acts
  as a workspace that provides discovery, aggregated views, and typically
  handles distribution of the bundled modules.

A typical project layout looks like this:

import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<FileTree>

- project-root/
  - changelog/
    - config.yaml
    - unreleased/
      - add-feature.md
      - fix-bug.md
    - releases/
      - v1.0.0/
        - manifest.yaml
        - notes.md
        - entries/
          - add-feature.md
          - fix-bug.md

</FileTree>

For a [package](/explanations/packages) layout (with `package.yaml`), the
structure may look like:

<FileTree>

- my-package/
  - package.yaml
  - changelog/
    - unreleased/
    - releases/

</FileTree>

## Commands

Run changelog commands from the project root or the `changelog/` directory:

```sh
uvx tenzir-changelog [command] [options]
```

All commands accept `--config` to point at an explicit configuration file (YAML
format, defaulting to `config.yaml`) and `--root` to operate on another
repository. When you omit both options, the CLI looks for `config.yaml` inside
the changelog root or, failing that, for a `package.yaml` one directory above
the changelog folder. The CLI also automatically uses a `changelog/`
subdirectory as the project root when running from a parent directory that
contains one. This _package mode_ lets you run commands from either the package
root or the `changelog/` directory without repeating `--root`.

### show

Display changelog entries in multiple views.

```text
tenzir-changelog show [identifiers...] [options]
```

| Option                | Description                                                 |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `identifiers`         | Row numbers, entry IDs, release versions, or `-` (optional) |
| `-c/--card`           | Show detailed cards for matching entries                    |
| `-m/--markdown`       | Export as Markdown                                          |
| `-j/--json`           | Export as JSON                                              |
| `--compact`           | Use compact bullet-list layout                              |
| `--no-compact`        | Use detailed card layout                                    |
| `--no-emoji`          | Remove type emoji from output                               |
| `--explicit-links`    | Render @mentions and PR refs as explicit Markdown links     |
| `--project <id>`      | Filter to specific project (repeatable)                     |
| `--component <label>` | Filter to specific component (repeatable)                   |
| `--banner`            | Display project banner above table output                   |

The table view (default) lists entries with ID, title, type, project, PRs, and
authors. Row numbers count backward from the newest entry, so `#1` always
targets the latest change.

### add

Create a new changelog entry in `unreleased/`.

```text
tenzir-changelog add [options]
```

| Option                 | Description                                  |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `--title <text>`       | Entry title                                  |
| `--type <type>`        | `breaking`, `feature`, `bugfix`, or `change` |
| `--description <text>` | Entry body                                   |
| `--author <name>`      | Contributor name (repeatable)                |
| `--co-author <name>`   | Additional contributor (repeatable)          |
| `--pr <number>`        | Pull request number (repeatable)             |
| `--component <label>`  | Component label (repeatable)                 |
| `--web`                | Open prefilled GitHub file creation URL      |

The command prompts for any information you do not pass explicitly. The first
invocation scaffolds the project automatically, creating a `changelog/`
subdirectory with `config.yaml` and `unreleased/`. When you provide an explicit
`--root` flag, the CLI uses that directory directly instead of creating a
subdirectory. The CLI names entry files using the slugified title (e.g.,
`my-feature.md`).

By default, the CLI infers the primary author from environment variables
(`TENZIR_CHANGELOG_AUTHOR`, `GH_USERNAME`) or the GitHub CLI (`gh api user`).
Using `--author` overrides this inference entirely. The `--co-author` option
adds to the inferred or explicit author list without replacing it, making it
ideal for AI-assisted development, pair programming, or collaborative
contributions. Duplicates are removed automatically while preserving order.

### release create

Stage a release under `releases/<version>/`.

```text
tenzir-changelog release create [version] [options]
```

| Option                | Description                                                |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `version`             | Release version (e.g., `v1.0.0`)                           |
| `--patch`             | Bump patch version from latest release                     |
| `--minor`             | Bump minor version from latest release                     |
| `--major`             | Bump major version from latest release                     |
| `--yes`               | Commit changes (default is dry run)                        |
| `--title <text>`      | Custom title for release heading                           |
| `--intro <text>`      | Inline intro text (mutually exclusive with `--intro-file`) |
| `--intro-file <path>` | Path to intro file (mutually exclusive with `--intro`)     |
| `--compact`           | Use bullet-list layout for `notes.md`                      |
| `--date <YYYY-MM-DD>` | Override release date                                      |

The command renders `notes.md`, updates `manifest.yaml`, and moves entry files
into `entries/`. It performs a dry run by default. When the release already
exists, the CLI appends additional unreleased entries.

### release version

Print the latest released version.

```text
tenzir-changelog release version [options]
```

| Option   | Description                      |
| -------- | -------------------------------- |
| `--bare` | Print version without `v` prefix |

Use this command in scripts to query the current version without parsing
output from other commands:

```sh
# Get the latest version
tenzir-changelog release version
# Output: v1.2.0

# Get version without prefix (for semver tools)
tenzir-changelog release version --bare
# Output: 1.2.0

# Use in commit messages
git commit -m "Release $(tenzir-changelog release version)"
```

### release notes

Re-export release notes without modifying files.

```text
tenzir-changelog release notes <identifier> [options]
```

| Option             | Description                                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `identifier`       | Release version or `-` for unreleased                   |
| `-m`               | Export as Markdown (default)                            |
| `-j`               | Export as JSON                                          |
| `--compact`        | Use bullet-list layout                                  |
| `--no-emoji`       | Drop type icons                                         |
| `--explicit-links` | Render @mentions and PR refs as explicit Markdown links |

Use `--explicit-links` when rendering Markdown outside of GitHub. By default,
the output uses `@username` and `#123` references that GitHub auto-links. With
`--explicit-links`, these become explicit Markdown links like
`[@username](https://github.com/username)` and
`[#123](https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123)`, making the output portable to
documentation sites, blogs, or other Markdown renderers.

### release publish

Publish a release to GitHub via `gh`.

```text
tenzir-changelog release publish [version] [options]
```

| Option             | Description                                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `version`          | Release version (defaults to latest)                    |
| `--yes`            | Skip confirmation prompts                               |
| `--draft`          | Mark as draft                                           |
| `--prerelease`     | Mark as prerelease                                      |
| `--no-latest`      | Prevent GitHub from marking as latest release           |
| `--tag`            | Create and push annotated Git tag                       |
| `--commit`         | Commit staged changes before tagging (requires `--tag`) |
| `--commit-message` | Custom commit message (default: `Release {version}`)    |

The command reads project metadata from `config.yaml` or `package.yaml` for the
repository slug and uses `notes.md` as the release body. Projects without a
`repository` field cannot publish—this is intentional for changelogs that track
changes without producing GitHub releases (e.g., modules in a workspace).

#### How it works

The `release publish` command executes the following steps:

1. **Validate configuration**: Checks that the `repository` field is set in
   `config.yaml` or `package.yaml`. This field determines the GitHub repository
   to publish to (e.g., `tenzir/tenzir`).

2. **Check for `gh` CLI**: Verifies that the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/)
   is installed and available in `PATH`. The command uses `gh` for all GitHub
   operations.

3. **Find release manifest**: Locates the release manifest at
   `releases/<version>/manifest.yaml`. Fails if the specified version doesn't
   exist.

4. **Verify release notes**: Checks that `releases/<version>/notes.md` exists
   and is non-empty. If missing, prompts you to run `release create` first.

5. **Commit staged changes** (if `--commit`): Creates a git commit with all
   staged changes. Requires `--tag` to be set. Uses the commit message from
   `--commit-message`, the `release.commit_message` config field, or defaults
   to `Release {version}`.

6. **Create and push git tag** (if `--tag`): Creates an annotated git tag named
   after the version with message `Release {version}`. If the tag already
   exists, skips creation but continues. Pushes the current branch to its
   upstream remote, then pushes the tag to the remote matching the configured
   repository.

7. **Check for existing GitHub release**: Queries GitHub to determine if a
   release with this version already exists.

8. **Create or update GitHub release**:
   - If the release exists, runs `gh release edit` to update the release notes
     and title.
   - If the release doesn't exist, runs `gh release create` with the version
     tag, release notes from `notes.md`, and optional `--draft`, `--prerelease`,
     or `--latest=false` flags.

9. **Confirm and execute**: Unless `--yes` is provided, prompts for confirmation
   before running the `gh` command. Shows the exact action (`gh release create`
   or `gh release edit`) that will run.

#### Typical workflow

A full release workflow with commit and tag:

```sh
# 1. Create the release (generates manifest.yaml and notes.md)
tenzir-changelog release create --minor --yes

# 2. Review the generated notes
tenzir-changelog release notes

# 3. Stage release files
git add changelog/releases/

# 4. Publish with commit and tag (defaults to latest release)
tenzir-changelog release publish --commit --tag --yes
```

Alternatively, commit manually to customize the message using `release version`:

```sh
# 3. Stage and commit with custom message
git add changelog/releases/
git commit -m "Release $(tenzir-changelog release version)"

# 4. Publish (defaults to latest release)
tenzir-changelog release publish --tag --yes
```

Both workflows are version-agnostic after step 1. The `release publish` command
defaults to the latest release when no version is specified.

### validate

Run structural checks across entry files, release manifests, and exported
documentation.

```text
tenzir-changelog validate
```

The validator reports missing metadata, unused entries, duplicate entry IDs, and
configuration drift across repositories. When modules are configured, validation
runs against the parent project and all discovered modules. Issues from modules
are prefixed with the module ID.

### modules

List discovered modules when a `modules` glob pattern is configured.

```text
tenzir-changelog modules
```

The command displays a table with module ID, name, relative path, and count of
unreleased entries. Use this to discover module paths for `--root` operations.

## Configuration

Configuration settings live in `config.yaml` by default, or you can store them
in `package.yaml` alongside the `changelog/` directory. `config.yaml` takes
precedence when both exist.

Configuration fields:

| Field          | Description                                                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `id`           | Canonical project slug written into entry frontmatter (required)   |
| `name`         | Human-friendly label surfaced in release titles and CLI output     |
| `description`  | Optional project description included in release manifests         |
| `repository`   | GitHub slug (e.g., `owner/repo`) required by `release publish`     |
| `export_style` | Default layout: `compact` (bullet-list) or omit for detailed cards |
| `components`   | Optional dict mapping component names to descriptions              |
| `modules`      | Optional glob pattern for discovering nested changelog projects    |
| `release`      | Release settings block (see below)                                 |

Example:

```yaml
id: tenzir-core
name: Tenzir Core
description: Core pipeline engine
repository: tenzir/tenzir
export_style: compact
components:
  cli: Command-line interface and user commands
  engine: Core pipeline engine internals
  operators: Built-in pipeline operators
release:
  commit_message: "Release {version}"
```

The `release` block supports:

| Field            | Default             | Description                                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `commit_message` | `Release {version}` | Template for `--commit` flag; `{version}` expands |

The first invocation of `tenzir-changelog add` scaffolds a `changelog/`
subdirectory with `config.yaml`, inferring defaults from the parent directory
name. When you provide an explicit `--root` flag, the CLI uses that directory
directly. Projects with `package.yaml` next to `changelog/` reuse the package
`id` and `name` automatically.

## Entry file format

Entry files live in `unreleased/` or `releases/<version>/entries/` as Markdown
files with YAML frontmatter. The CLI names entry files using the slugified title
(e.g., `my-feature.md`, `fix-bug.md`).

Example entry:

```markdown
---
title: Add pipeline builder
type: feature
author: alice
created: 2025-10-16T14:30:00Z
pr: 101
component: cli
---

Introduces the new pipeline builder UI with drag-and-drop support.
```

You can use either singular (`author`, `pr`, `component`) or plural (`authors`,
`prs`, `components`) keys. The singular form is shorthand for single values and
is normalized to the plural form internally.

Frontmatter fields:

| Field                      | Type         | Required | Description                                    |
| -------------------------- | ------------ | -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `title`                    | string       | yes      | Entry title                                    |
| `type`                     | string       | yes      | `breaking`, `feature`, `bugfix`, or `change`   |
| `author` / `authors`       | list[string] | no       | Contributor names (singular or plural form)    |
| `created`                  | string       | yes      | Creation datetime in ISO 8601 UTC format       |
| `pr` / `prs`               | list[int]    | no       | Pull request numbers (singular or plural form) |
| `component` / `components` | list[string] | no       | Labels matching configured components          |

## Release manifest format

Release manifests live at `releases/<version>/manifest.yaml` and record metadata
about a release.

Example manifest:

```yaml
created: 2025-10-18
title: Big Release
intro: |
  Welcome to version 1.0.0!

  This release includes significant performance improvements.
```

Manifest fields:

| Field     | Type   | Required | Description                                      |
| --------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `created` | string | yes      | Release date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format              |
| `title`   | string | no       | Custom title for the release heading             |
| `intro`   | string | no       | Introductory content (supports Markdown)         |
| `modules` | dict   | no       | Module versions at release time (auto-populated) |

The `modules` field is automatically populated when creating a release for a
parent project with configured modules. It maps module IDs to their latest
versions, enabling incremental module summaries in subsequent releases.

Example manifest with modules:

```yaml
created: 2025-10-18
title: Marketplace v1.0.0
intro: |
  Initial release with all plugins.
modules:
  git: v1.0.0
  docs: v1.1.0
  changelog: v1.2.0
```

The CLI generates `notes.md` with an H1 heading followed by the intro and
grouped entry sections. The heading format depends on whether a custom title is
set:

- **With custom title**: `# {title}` (e.g., `# Big Release`)
- **Without title**: `# {name} {version}` (e.g., `# My Project v1.0.0`)

Intro content comes from either `--intro` (inline text) or `--intro-file` (file
path) when creating a release.

## JSON export format

JSON exports (`-j` flag) return structured objects for programmatic consumption.
Entries include `prs` and `authors` fields as structured objects with URLs.

### PR objects

Each PR is an object with `number` and optional `url`:

```json
{
  "prs": [
    {"number": 123, "url": "https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123"},
    {"number": 456, "url": "https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/456"}
  ]
}
```

The `url` field is included when the project's `repository` setting is
configured. Without a repository, PRs contain only the `number` field.

### Author objects

Each author is an object with either `handle` + `url` (for GitHub handles) or
`name` (for full names):

```json
{
  "authors": [
    {"handle": "alice", "url": "https://github.com/alice"},
    {"name": "Bob Smith"}
  ]
}
```

GitHub handles (names without spaces) include a `url` field linking to the
user's profile. Full names (containing spaces) include only the `name` field.

## Environment variables

The CLI recognizes these environment variables:

| Variable       | Description                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | GitHub token with `repo` scope for private repos |

## Modules

Modules enable monorepo support by discovering nested changelog projects via a
glob pattern. Each module is a fully independent project with its own
configuration, versioning, and release cycle. The parent project serves as a
**workspace** that provides discovery and aggregated views.

### Configuration

Add a `modules` field to your parent project's `config.yaml`:

```yaml
id: library
name: Tenzir Library
modules: "../packages/*/changelog"
```

The glob pattern resolves relative to the changelog root directory. Each matched
directory must contain a valid `config.yaml` with its own `id` and `name`:

```yaml
id: amazon_vpc_flow
name: Amazon VPC Flow Package
```

### Parent as workspace

When a parent project defines `modules`, it typically acts as a workspace
coordinator rather than a versioned project itself. The parent provides:

- **Discovery**: Automatically finds modules matching the glob pattern
- **Aggregation**: Shows entries from all modules in unified views
- **Validation**: Checks module ID uniqueness and configuration validity

The parent may or may not have its own releases. A parent without releases
exists purely for coordination.

### Aggregated views

When `modules` is configured, `show` includes entries from all modules. The
table displays a **Project** column showing which project (parent or module)
each entry belongs to:

```sh
# Show all entries (parent + modules)
tenzir-changelog show

# Show only parent entries
tenzir-changelog show --project parent
```

### Aggregated release summaries

When creating a release for a parent project, `release create` automatically
appends a summary of module changes to the release notes. Each module with new
entries since the previous parent release gets a section showing:

- The module name and version as a heading
- A compact bullet list of entries with emoji prefix, title, and byline

```

The release manifest records each module's version at release time in the
`modules` field. Subsequent releases compare against this baseline and only
include entries from module releases newer than the recorded version. This
prevents duplicate entries across parent releases.

The `release notes` command also renders module summaries when viewing a
specific release, using the same incremental logic based on the manifest's
recorded module versions.

### Operating on modules

Each module is a standalone changelog project. Use `--root` to operate on a
specific module:

```sh
# Add entry to a module
tenzir-changelog --root ../packages/amazon_vpc_flow/changelog add --title "Add parser"

# Create a release for a module
tenzir-changelog --root ../packages/amazon_vpc_flow/changelog release create v1.0.0
```

The `modules` command lists discovered modules with their paths for convenient
copy-paste into `--root` flags.

### Independent versioning

Each module maintains its own version history and releases on its own schedule.
There is no coordinated release mechanism—modules evolve independently.

Typically, modules do not publish GitHub releases themselves. Instead, the
parent workspace handles distribution (e.g., bundling modules into a product
release or publishing to a package registry). Modules that need to publish
standalone GitHub releases can add a `repository` field to their configuration.

### Validation

When `modules` is configured, `tenzir-changelog validate` checks:

- Module ID uniqueness across all discovered modules
- Valid configuration in each module directory

## Troubleshooting

- **Validation errors** – Run `tenzir-changelog validate` to identify missing
  metadata, unused entries, or duplicate IDs.
- **Component mismatch** – When `components` is configured, ensure every entry
  either omits `component` or uses an allowed label.
- **Configuration not found** – Ensure `config.yaml` exists in the changelog
  root or `package.yaml` sits next to the `changelog/` directory. Run
  `tenzir-changelog add` once to scaffold the configuration.
- **Version bump fails** – Bump flags read the latest release manifest on disk.
  Create an initial release with an explicit version before using
  `--patch/--minor/--major`.
