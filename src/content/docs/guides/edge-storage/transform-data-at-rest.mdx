title: Transform data at rest
---

:::caution[Currently CLI only]
This feature is currently only available on the command line using the
`tenzir-ctl` binary. We're working on bringing it back as an operator so that
you can also use it from the app.

Tenzir provdides several features to transform historical data at a node.

## Delete old data when reaching storage quota

The disk-monitoring feature enables periodic deletion of events based on
utilized disk storage. To limit the disk space used by a node, configure a disk
quota:

```sh
tenzir-node --disk-quota-high=1TiB
```

Whenever a node detects that its database has exceeded the configured quota, it
will erase the oldest data. You can specify a corridor for the disk space usage
by additionally providing the option `--disk-quota-low`. This can be used to
avoid running permanently at the upper limit and to instad batch the deletion
operations together.

The full set of available options looks like this:

```yaml
tenzir:
  start:
    # Triggers removal of old data when the DB dir exceeds the disk budget.
    disk-budget-high: 0K
    # When the DB dir exceeds the budget, Tenzir erases data until the directory
    # size falls below this value.
    disk-budget-low: 0K
    # Seconds between successive disk space checks.
    disk-budget-check-interval: 90
```

:::note
When using this method, we recommend placing the log file outside of the
database directory. It counts towards the size calculations, but cannot be
automatically deleted during a deletion cycle.

## Transform old data when reaching storage quota

Instead of deleting data periodically, a node can also trigger **spatial
compaction** when exceeding a given disk budget. A spatial compaction cycle
transforms data until disk usage falls below the budget, e.g., by removing
columns or rows from certain events, or by deleting them entirely.

When the disk budget exceeds the configured threshold, the node decides what
data to compact. The compaction _mode_ defines how this happens. Currently,
there exists only one mode: weighted age.

To compute the weighted age, the node divides the actual age of an event with
the weight assigned to this event type. For example, applying a weight of 100 to
an event that is 100 days old would yield a weighted age of 1 day. This causes
it to be transformed after events that are 50 days old. Conversely, a weights
less than one results in an older weighted age, resulting in earlier
consideration in a compaction cycle.

The default weight is 1 for all event types. Here is an example configuration
that adjusts the weights:

```yaml
tenzir:
  plugins: [compaction]
plugins:
  compaction:
    space:
      mode: weighted-age
      interval: 6 hours
      disk-budget-high: 10TiB
      disk-budget-low: 8TiB
      weights:
        - weight: 0.1
          types: [suricata.flow]
          #pipeline: …
        - weight: 100
          types: [suricata.alert]
          #pipeline: …
```

The `pipeline` key for each type is optional. If present, the corresponding
pipeline processes all matching events. If absent, the nodes deletes matching
events.

Two additional keys are useful to fine-tune the behavior of the compaction
plugin:

1. `compaction.space.scan-binary`: an absolute path to a binary that should be
   executed to determine the current disk usage
2. `compaction.space.step-size`: adjust how many compaction candidates should be
   processed before re-checking the size of the database directory

## Transform data after exceeding a retention span

A node triggers **temporal compaction** according to a set of rules that define
how to transform events after they reach a specfic age. This declarative
specification makes it easy to express fine-grained data retention policies,
which is often needed for regulatory requirements and compliance.

For each compaction cycle, the node processes all rules and identifies what
subset of the data has become subject to transformation. To this end, each rule
defines a _minimum_ age, i.e., a lower bound that must be exceeded before the
corresponding events undergo their configured pipeline.

To configure temporal compaction, provide a list of compaction rules under the
key `plugins.compaction.time` in the configuration. A compaction rule defines
the minimum age using key `after`, the pipeline to apply with the key
`pipeline`, the scope in terms of schema using the key `types`, and a name to
uniquely refer to the rule. Omitting the `types` key causes temporal compaction
rules to be applied to all schemas.

By default, a compaction rule consumes its input, i.e., it erases the original
events from the database and replaces them with the transformed events. The
`preserve-input` option can be specified on a temporal compaction rule to
override this behavior and to keep the input partitions available.

:::note
A node applies each rule only once per partition and stores the applied rule
name within the partition meta data. If you rename a rule in the configuration
and reload a new compaction configuration, already compacted partitions will
undergo another round of compaction.
:::

The pipelines referenced in the compaction configuration must be defined in your
configuration.

```yaml
plugins:
  compaction:
    time:
      # How often to check the `after` condition below.
      interval: 1 day
      rules:
        - after: 2 days
          name: uri_scrubbing
          pipeline: |
            replace net.url="xxx"
          types:
            - zeek.http
            - suricata.http
        - after: 7 days
          name: flow_reduction
          pipeline: |
            summarize
              pkts_toserver=sum(flow.pkts_toserver),
              pkts_toclient=sum(flow.pkts_toclient),
              bytes_toserver=sum(flow.bytes_toserver),
              bytes_toclient=sum(flow.bytes_toclient),
              start=min(flow.start),
              end=max(flow.end)
            by
              timestamp,
              src_ip,
              dest_ip
            resolution
              10 mins
          preserve-input: true
          types:
            - suricata.flow
```

## Trigger a compaction cycle manually

You can also interact with the compaction plugin on the command line, through
the `compaction` subcommand. Use the `list` subcommand to show all configured
compaction rules:

```sh
tenzir-ctl compaction list
```

You can then trigger a compaction manually via `run`:

```sh
tenzir-ctl compaction run <rule>
```
