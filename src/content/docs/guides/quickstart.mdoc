Drowning in logs, alerts, and rigid tools? Meet **Tenzir**—your engine for
taming security data. In just a few minutes, you'll be ingesting, transforming,
and enriching data on your terms, with full control.
Here's what you'll accomplish:

{% steps %}

1. Use Tenzir instantly
2. Deploy your first pipeline
3. See results in action

{% /steps %}

## Prerequisites

You need zero infrastructure to get started—just a browser and access to
[app.tenzir.com](https://app.tenzir.com).

It helps if you have basic familiarity with logs or security telemetry, but it's
not required.

## Setup & Deploy a Demo Node

Visit [app.tenzir.com](https://app.tenzir.com), sign in to [create a free
account](/guides/account-creation), and you'll see this page:

![Landing page](./node-setup/provision-a-node/new-account.png)

Let's get us a demo node so that we can run pipelines:

{% steps %}

1. Click **Cloud-hosted demo-node**.
2. Click **Add node**.
3. Click **Get Started**.

{% /steps %}

Our node is starting up. This can take up to 2 minutes. Sorry for the wait!
We'll cut down this time soon. Grab a coffee and relax while we get everything
set up. ☕

## Your First Pipeline: Ingest, Filter, Import

Now that our node is up and running, let's create a pipeline that:

1. Reads a sample log file
2. Filters out unnecessary events
3. Stores the data in the node's edge storage

## What's Next?

You've just scratched the surface. Here's where to go next:

1. Deploy your own node
2. Visualize pipeline insights and build dashboards
3. Map your logs to OCSF
4. Send enriched data to your data lake
