The Tenzir package includes two binaries:

- **`tenzir`**: Execute a single pipeline from the command line
- **`tenzir-node`**: Run a persistent node for continuous pipeline execution

These binaries run pipelines on your machine. To manage pipelines through a web
interface, [create an account](/guides/installation/create-account) and use the
[platform](https://app.tenzir.com). See the [architecture
overview](/explanations/architecture) to learn how they fit together.

Choose the installation method that fits your use case.

## uvx

Run pipelines instantly without installation:

```sh
uvx tenzir 'from {x: 42}'
```

Works on macOS (Apple Silicon) and Linux (ARM/AMD).

:::note[Running the latest version]
The `@latest` suffix ensures you always get the most recent Tenzir release from
PyPI. We recommend using `uvx tenzir@latest` to stay up to date. If startup time
is a concern, omit `@latest` and manually refresh the cache with
`uvx tenzir@latest` when you want updates.
:::

## curl installer

Run the installer and follow the instructions to download the binaries, and
optionally start a node:

```sh
curl https://get.tenzir.app | sh
```

The installer script asks for confirmation before performing the installation.
It uses the package manager of your Linux distribution to install the Tenzir
package. This typically also creates a [systemd](https://systemd.io) unit and
starts the node automatically.

## Linux

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="debian" label="Debian" icon="linux">

Download the latest [Debian package][tenzir-debian-package] and install it via
`dpkg`:

```sh
dpkg -i tenzir-static-amd64-linux.deb
```

You can uninstall the Tenzir package via `apt-get remove tenzir`. Use `purge`
instead of `remove` if you also want to delete the state directory and leave no
trace.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="rpm" label="RPM-based" icon="linux">

Download the latest [RPM package][tenzir-rpm-package] and install it via `rpm`:

```sh
rpm -i tenzir-static-amd64-linux.rpm
```

[tenzir-rpm-package]: https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/releases/latest/download/tenzir-static-amd64-linux.rpm

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="nix" label="Nix" icon="nix">

Run Tenzir ad-hoc without installing:

```sh
nix run github:tenzir/tenzir/latest
```

Or enter a shell with Tenzir available:

```sh
nix shell github:tenzir/tenzir/latest -c tenzir 'from {x: 42}'
```

Install a Tenzir Node by adding `github:tenzir/tenzir/latest` to your flake
inputs, or use your preferred method to include third-party modules on classic
NixOS.

:::note[Pre-built only!]
The default attributes of the flake contain some closed source plugins and will
fail to download locally. The flake is only for public consumption together with
the [Tenzir cachix cache](https://tenzir.cachix.org).

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="docker" label="Docker" icon="seti:docker">

Run pipelines in a container without installing anything locally:

```sh
docker run --rm -it tenzir/tenzir 'from {x: 42}'
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="tarball" label="Tarball" icon="seti:folder">

Download a tarball with our [static binary][tenzir-tarball] for all Linux
distributions and unpack it into `/opt/tenzir`:

```sh
tar xzf tenzir-static-x86_64-linux.tar.gz -C /
```

[tenzir-tarball]: https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/releases/latest/download/tenzir-static-x86_64-linux.tar.gz

We also offer prebuilt statically linked binaries for every Git commit to the
`main` branch:

```sh
curl -O https://storage.googleapis.com/tenzir-dist-public/packages/main/tarball/tenzir-static-main.gz
```
