title: Use the platform CLI
---

We provide a command-line utility that simplifies managing users, organizations,
workspaces, and nodes.

Install the [`tenzir-platform`](https://pypi.org/project/tenzir-platform/)
package from PyPI.

## Prepare your environment

You must provide the following environment variables for interacting with the
platform through the CLI:

```sh
TENZIR_PLATFORM_CLI_API_ENDPOINT=api.platform.example:5000
TENZIR_PLATFORM_CLI_OIDC_ISSUER_URL=YOUR_OIDC_ISSUER_URL
TENZIR_PLATFORM_CLI_OIDC_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_OIDC_CLIENT_ID
TENZIR_PLATFORM_CLI_OIDC_AUDIENCE=YOUR_OIDC_AUDIENCE
```

## Run platform commands

Read our documentation on the [Tenzir Platform
CLI](../../../../reference/platform-cli) to learn more about managing your
platform deployment.
