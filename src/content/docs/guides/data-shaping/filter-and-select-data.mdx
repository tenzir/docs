title: Filter and select data
---

Filtering and selecting are fundamental operations when working with data
streams. This guide shows you how to filter events based on conditions and
select specific fields from your data.

## Understanding operators vs functions

Before we dive in, it's important to understand a key distinction in TQL:

- **Operators** like [`where`](/reference/operators/where),
  [`select`](/reference/operators/select), and [`drop`](/reference/operators/drop)
  work on entire event streams
- **Functions** like [`starts_with()`](/reference/functions/starts_with) or
  mathematical comparisons work on individual values within events

You'll see both in action throughout this guide.

## Filter events with conditions

Use the [`where`](/reference/operators/where) operator to keep only events that
match specific conditions.

### Basic filtering

Filter events based on a simple condition. This example keeps only successful
HTTP requests (status code 200):

```tql
from {status: 200, path: "/api/users"},
     {status: 404, path: "/api/missing"},
     {status: 200, path: "/home"}
where status == 200
```

```tql
{status: 200, path: "/api/users"}
{status: 200, path: "/home"}
```

The event with `status: 404` is filtered out because it doesn't match our condition.

### Combining conditions

Use logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) to combine multiple conditions:

```tql
from {status: 200, path: "/api/users", size: 1024},
     {status: 404, path: "/api/missing", size: 512},
     {status: 200, path: "/home", size: 2048}
where status == 200 and size > 1000
```

```tql
{status: 200, path: "/api/users", size: 1024}
{status: 200, path: "/home", size: 2048}
```

You can also use `or` and `not` with functions like [`starts_with()`](/reference/functions/starts_with):

```tql
from {status: 200, path: "/api/users"},
     {status: 404, path: "/api/missing"},
     {status: 500, path: "/api/error"}
where status == 200 or not path.starts_with("/api/m")
```

```tql
{status: 200, path: "/api/users"}
{status: 500, path: "/api/error"}
```

### Using functions in filters

Functions work on values to create more sophisticated filters. For example,
[`ends_with()`](/reference/functions/ends_with) checks string suffixes:

```tql
from {user: "alice", email: "alice@example.com"},
     {user: "bob", email: "bob@gmail.com"},
     {user: "charlie", email: "charlie@example.com"}
where email.ends_with("example.com")
```

```tql
{user: "alice", email: "alice@example.com"}
{user: "charlie", email: "charlie@example.com"}
```

### Filtering with patterns

Match patterns using regular expressions with
[`match_regex()`](/reference/functions/match_regex):

```tql
from {log: "Error: Connection timeout"},
     {log: "Info: Request processed"},
     {log: "Error: Invalid input"}
where log.match_regex("Error:")
```

```tql
{log: "Error: Connection timeout"}
{log: "Error: Invalid input"}
```

## Select specific fields

The [`select`](/reference/operators/select) operator lets you pick which fields
to keep in your output.

### Basic field selection

Select only the fields you need:

```tql
from {name: "alice", age: 30, city: "NYC"},
     {name: "bob", age: 25, city: "SF"}
select name, age
```

```tql
{name: "alice", age: 30}
{name: "bob", age: 25}
```

### Renaming fields

You can rename fields while selecting them. This is useful when standardizing
field names from different data sources:

```tql
from {first_name: "alice", years: 30},
     {first_name: "bob", years: 25}
select name=first_name, age=years
```

```tql
{name: "alice", age: 30}
{name: "bob", age: 25}
```

Here `first_name` becomes `name` and `years` becomes `age` in the output.

### Computing new fields

Create new fields with expressions during selection:

```tql
from {price: 100, tax_rate: 0.08},
     {price: 50, tax_rate: 0.08}
select price, tax=price * tax_rate, total=price * (1 + tax_rate)
```

```tql
{price: 100, tax: 8.0, total: 108.0}
{price: 50, tax: 4.0, total: 54.0}
```

## Remove unwanted fields

The [`drop`](/reference/operators/drop) operator removes specified fields,
keeping everything else.

### Basic field removal

Remove fields you don't need:

```tql
from {user: "alice", password: "secret", email: "alice@example.com"},
     {user: "bob", password: "hidden", email: "bob@example.com"}
drop password
```

```tql
{user: "alice", email: "alice@example.com"}
{user: "bob", email: "bob@example.com"}
```

### Dropping multiple fields

Remove several fields at once:

```tql
from {id: 1, internal_id: "xyz", debug: true, name: "alice"},
     {id: 2, internal_id: "abc", debug: false, name: "bob"}
drop internal_id, debug
```

```tql
{id: 1, name: "alice"}
{id: 2, name: "bob"}
```

## Add computed fields

Use the [`set`](/reference/operators/set) operator to override existing fields
and add new fields without removing existing ones.

:::tip[Implied operator]
The [`set`](/reference/operators/set) operator is _implied_, i.e., you can omit
it to keep your pipeline definitions terse. In other words, it suffices to write
an assignment in the form `x = y` instead of `set x = y`.
:::

### Adding simple fields

Add a constant field to all events:

```tql
from {user: "alice"},
     {user: "bob"}
set source = "api"
```

```tql
{user: "alice", source: "api"}
{user: "bob", source: "api"}
```

### Computing field values

Add fields based on calculations:

```tql
from {bytes_sent: 1024, bytes_received: 2048},
     {bytes_sent: 512, bytes_received: 1024}
set total_bytes = bytes_sent + bytes_received
```

```tql
{bytes_sent: 1024, bytes_received: 2048, total_bytes: 3072}
{bytes_sent: 512, bytes_received: 1024, total_bytes: 1536}
```

### Using the `else` keyword

Use the `else` word to provide default values for null fields:

```tql
from {name: "alice", score: 85},
     {name: "bob"},
     {name: "charlie", score: 95}
score = score? else 0
```

```tql
{name: "alice", score: 85}
{name: "bob", score: 0}
{name: "charlie", score: 95}
```

:::caution[Accessing non-existent fields]
Because the second event had no `score` field, the `else` keyword filled in a
default value of `0`. However, accessing non-existent fields generates a
warning. We use the trailing question mark (`?`) to suppress warnings when
accessing fields that may not exist, i.e., `score? else 0` in the above example.
This is distinctively different from an existing field with a null value, which
does not elicit a warning.

## Combining operations

Real-world pipelines often combine multiple operations:

```tql
from {method: "GET", path: "/api/users", status: 200, duration_ms: 45},
     {method: "POST", path: "/api/users", status: 201, duration_ms: 120},
     {method: "GET", path: "/api/users/123", status: 404, duration_ms: 15}
where status >= 200 and status < 300
select method, path, duration = duration_ms.milliseconds()
```

```tql
{method: "GET", path: "/api/users", duration: 45ms}
{method: "POST", path: "/api/users", duration: 120ms}
```

## Best practices

1. **Filter early**: Apply [`where`](/reference/operators/where) conditions as
   early as possible to reduce the amount of data flowing through your pipeline.

2. **Select only what you need**: Use [`select`](/reference/operators/select) to
   keep only necessary fields, especially when dealing with large events.

3. **Choose the right operator**:
   - Use [`select`](/reference/operators/select) when you want to restrict the
     output to specific fields.
   - Use [`drop`](/reference/operators/drop) when you want to remove a few
     fields from many.
   - Use [`set`](/reference/operators/set) when you want to add/override fields
     without changing existing ones.

4. **Understand null handling**: The [`where`](/reference/operators/where)
   operator skips events where the condition evaluates to null or false. Use the
   question mark operator (`?`) to suppress warnings when accessing fields that
   may not exist.
