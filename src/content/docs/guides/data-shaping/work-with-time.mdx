title: Work with time
---

Time is fundamental in data analysis. Whether you're analyzing logs, tracking
events, or monitoring systems, you need to parse timestamps, calculate
durations, and format dates. This guide shows you how to work with time values
in TQL.

## Understand time types

TQL has two main time-related types:

- **`time`**: A specific point in time (timestamp)
- **`duration`**: A span of time (interval)

```tql
from {
  timestamp: 2024-01-15T10:30:45.123456,
  interval: 5min
}
later = timestamp + interval
earlier = timestamp - 2h
```

```tql
{
  timestamp: 2024-01-15T10:30:45.123456Z,
  interval: 5min,
  later: 2024-01-15T10:35:45.123456Z,
  earlier: 2024-01-15T08:30:45.123456Z
}
```

## Get the current time

Use [`now()`](/reference/functions/now) to get the current timestamp:

```tql
from {
  current_time: now()
}
today = current_time.round(1d)
```

```tql
{
  current_time: 2025-07-21T19:06:55.047259Z,
  today: 2025-07-22T00:00:00Z,
}

```

## Parse time from strings

TQL offers two functions for parsing timestamps from strings:
[`time()`](/reference/functions/time) for automatic format detection and
[`parse_time()`](/reference/functions/parse_time) for custom formats.

### Automatic parsing with `time()`

The [`time()`](/reference/functions/time) function automatically recognizes many
common timestamp formats:

```tql
from {
  iso_date: "2024-01-15",
  iso_datetime: "2024-01-15T10:30:45",
  with_timezone: "2024-01-15T10:30:45+02:00",
  unix_epoch: "@1705316445",
}
iso_date = iso_date.time()
iso_datetime = iso_datetime.time()
with_timezone = with_timezone.time()
unix_epoch = unix_epoch.time()
```

```tql
{
  iso_date: 2024-01-15T00:00:00Z,
  iso_datetime: 2024-01-15T10:30:45Z,
  with_timezone: 2024-01-15T08:30:45Z,
  unix_epoch: 2024-01-15T11:00:45Z,
}
```

The [`time()`](/reference/functions/time) function also supports relative time
expressions:

```tql
from {
  now: time("now"),
  one_hour_ago: time("1h ago"),
  in_two_days: time("in 2d"),
  relative: time("now - 30min"),
}
```

### Custom formats with `parse_time()`

For timestamps in non-standard formats, use
[`parse_time()`](/reference/functions/parse_time) with an explicit format
string:

```tql
from {
  apache: "15/Jan/2024:10:30:45",
  us_date: "01/15/2024 10:30:45",
}
apache_time = apache.parse_time("%d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S")
us_time = us_date.parse_time("%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S")
```

```tql
{
  apache: "15/Jan/2024:10:30:45",
  us_date: "01/15/2024 10:30:45",
  apache_time: 2024-01-15T10:30:45Z,
  us_time: 2024-01-15T10:30:45Z,
}
```

Common format specifiers:

- `%Y` - 4-digit year
- `%m` - Month (01-12)
- `%d` - Day (01-31)
- `%H` - Hour (00-23)
- `%M` - Minute (00-59)
- `%S` - Second (00-59)
- `%b` - Month name (Jan, Feb, etc.)
- `%a` - Weekday name (Mon, Tue, etc.)

### When to use which

- **[`time()`](/reference/functions/time)**: Use for ISO 8601 timestamps, Unix
  epochs (with `@` prefix), or relative time expressions. No format string
  needed.
- **[`parse_time()`](/reference/functions/parse_time)**: Use for custom formats
  like Apache logs, US date formats, or any non-standard timestamp layout.

## Format time to strings

Convert timestamps to custom string formats with [`format_time()`](/reference/functions/format_time):

```tql
from {event_time: 2024-01-15T10:30:45.123456}
iso = event_time.format_time("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%f")
date_only = event_time.format_time("%Y-%m-%d")
us_format = event_time.format_time("%m/%d/%Y %I:%M %p")
log_format = event_time.format_time("%d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S")
```

```tql
{
  event_time: 2024-01-15T10:30:45.123456Z,
  iso: "2024-01-15T10:30:45.123456000.%f",
  date_only: "2024-01-15",
  us_format: "01/15/2024 10:30 AM",
  log_format: "15/Jan/2024:10:30:45.123456000"
}
```

## Extract time components

Get individual parts of a timestamp using [`year()`](/reference/functions/year), [`month()`](/reference/functions/month), [`day()`](/reference/functions/day), [`hour()`](/reference/functions/hour), [`minute()`](/reference/functions/minute), and [`second()`](/reference/functions/second):

```tql
from {timestamp: 2024-01-15T10:30:45.123456}
year = timestamp.year()
month = timestamp.month()
day = timestamp.day()
hour = timestamp.hour()
minute = timestamp.minute()
second = timestamp.second()
```

```tql
{
  timestamp: 2024-01-15T10:30:45.123456Z,
  year: 2024,
  month: 1,
  day: 15,
  hour: 10,
  minute: 30,
  second: 45.123456
}
```

## Work with durations

Create and manipulate time intervals:

```tql
from {
  start: 2024-01-15T10:00:00,
  end: 2024-01-15T14:30:00
}
elapsed = end - start
hours = elapsed.count_hours()
minutes = elapsed.count_minutes()
seconds = elapsed.count_seconds()
```

```tql
{
  start: 2024-01-15T10:00:00Z,
  end: 2024-01-15T14:30:00Z,
  elapsed: 4.5h,
  hours: 4.5,
  minutes: 270.0,
  seconds: 16200.0
}
```

### Count duration components

Extract different time units from durations:

```tql
from {
  duration: 90d + 4h + 30min + 45s + 123ms + 456us + 789ns
}
years = duration.count_years()
months = duration.count_months()
weeks = duration.count_weeks()
days = duration.count_days()
hours = duration.count_hours()
minutes = duration.count_minutes()
seconds = duration.count_seconds()
milliseconds = duration.count_milliseconds()
microseconds = duration.count_microseconds()
nanoseconds = duration.count_nanoseconds()
```

```tql
{
  duration: 90.18802226223136d,
  years: 0.24692641809819874,
  months: 2.963117017178385,
  weeks: 12.884003180318764,
  days: 90.18802226223136,
  hours: 2164.5125342935526,
  minutes: 129870.75205761315,
  seconds: 7792245.123456789,
  milliseconds: 7792245123.456789,
  microseconds: 7792245123456.789,
  nanoseconds: 7792245123456789,
}
```

### Convert between time units

Use [`months()`](/reference/functions/months) to create month-based durations:

```tql
from {
  quarterly_period: 3
}
quarter = quarterly_period.months()
days_in_quarter = quarter.count_days()
weeks_in_quarter = quarter.count_weeks()
```

```tql
{
  quarterly_period: 3,
  quarter: 91.310625d,
  days_in_quarter: 91.310625,
  weeks_in_quarter: 13.044375
}
```

### Create durations

Use duration literals or functions:

```tql
from {
  five_minutes: 5min,
  one_hour: 1h,
  custom: 90.seconds(),
  from_parts: 2.hours() + 30.minutes(),
}
```

```tql
{
  five_minutes: 5min,
  one_hour: 1h,
  custom: 1.5min,
  from_parts: 2.5h,
}
```

Duration units:

- `ns` or `nanoseconds()` - Nanoseconds
- `us` or `microseconds()` - Microseconds
- `ms` or `milliseconds()` - Milliseconds
- `s` or `seconds()` - Seconds
- `min` or `minutes()` - Minutes
- `h` or `hours()` - Hours
- `d` or `days()` - Days (24 hours)
- `w` or `weeks()` - Weeks (7 days)
- `y` or `years()` - Years (365 days)

## Calculate time differences

Find elapsed time between events:

```tql
from {
  login: 2024-01-15T09:00:00,
  first_action: 2024-01-15T09:05:30,
  logout: 2024-01-15T17:30:00,
}
time_to_action = first_action - login
session_duration = logout - login
active_hours = session_duration.count_hours()
```

```tql
{
  login: 2024-01-15T09:00:00Z,
  first_action: 2024-01-15T09:05:30Z,
  logout: 2024-01-15T17:30:00Z,
  time_to_action: 5.5min,
  session_duration: 8.5h,
  active_hours: 8.5,
}
```

## Add and subtract time

Perform time arithmetic:

```tql
from {
  event_time: 2024-01-15T10:30:00
}
one_hour_later = event_time + 1h
yesterday = event_time - 1d
next_week = event_time + 7d
thirty_mins_ago = event_time - 30min
```

```tql
{
  event_time: 2024-01-15T10:30:00Z,
  one_hour_later: 2024-01-15T11:30:00Z,
  yesterday: 2024-01-14T10:30:00Z,
  next_week: 2024-01-22T10:30:00Z,
  thirty_mins_ago: 2024-01-15T10:00:00Z
}
```

## Round timestamps

Round timestamps to specific intervals:

```tql
from {
  precise_time: 2024-01-15T10:37:42.847621
}
to_minute = precise_time.round(1min)
to_hour = precise_time.round(1h)
to_day = precise_time.round(1d)
to_5min = precise_time.round(5min)
```

```tql
{
  precise_time: 2024-01-15T10:37:42.847621Z,
  to_minute: 2024-01-15T10:38:00Z,
  to_hour: 2024-01-15T11:00:00Z,
  to_day: 2024-01-15T00:00:00Z,
  to_5min: 2024-01-15T10:40:00Z
}
```

## Convert Unix timestamps

Unix timestamps represent time as seconds (or fractions) since January 1, 1970.
TQL supports both parsing and generating Unix timestamps.

### Parse Unix timestamps

For string inputs, use [`time()`](/reference/functions/time) with the `@`
prefix:

```tql
from {
  unix_str: "@1705316445",
  unix_fractional: "@1705316445.123456",
}
parsed = unix_str.time()
parsed_fractional = unix_fractional.time()
```

```tql
{
  unix_str: "@1705316445",
  unix_fractional: "@1705316445.123456",
  parsed: 2024-01-15T11:00:45Z,
  parsed_fractional: 2024-01-15T11:00:45.123456Z,
}
```

### Convert numeric timestamps

For numeric inputs, use [`from_epoch()`](/reference/functions/from_epoch) with
the appropriate time unit:

```tql
from {
  unix_seconds: 1705316445,
  unix_millis: 1705316445123,
  unix_micros: 1705316445123456
}
from_seconds = unix_seconds.seconds().from_epoch()
from_millis = unix_millis.milliseconds().from_epoch()
from_micros = unix_micros.microseconds().from_epoch()
```

```tql
{
  unix_seconds: 1705316445,
  unix_millis: 1705316445123,
  unix_micros: 1705316445123456,
  from_seconds: 2024-01-15T11:00:45Z,
  from_millis: 2024-01-15T11:00:45.123Z,
  from_micros: 2024-01-15T11:00:45.123456Z,
}
```

### Convert back to Unix timestamp

Use [`since_epoch()`](/reference/functions/since_epoch) to get the duration
since the Unix epoch:

```tql
from {timestamp: 2024-01-15T11:00:45Z}
unix_seconds = timestamp.since_epoch().count_seconds()
unix_millis = timestamp.since_epoch().count_milliseconds()
```

```tql
{
  timestamp: 2024-01-15T11:00:45Z,
  unix_seconds: 1705316445.0,
  unix_millis: 1705316445000.0,
}
```

## Practical examples

### Calculate request duration

```tql
from {
  request_start: 2024-01-15T10:30:45.123,
  request_end: 2024-01-15T10:30:47.456,
}
duration = request_end - request_start
duration_ms = duration.count_milliseconds()
```

```tql
{
  request_start: 2024-01-15T10:30:45.123Z,
  request_end: 2024-01-15T10:30:47.456Z,
  duration: 2.333s,
  duration_ms: 2333.0,
}
```

### Group events by time window

```tql
from {
  event_time: 2024-01-15T10:37:42.847621,
  event_type: "login",
}
hour_bucket = event_time.round(1h)
day_bucket = event_time.round(1d)
five_min_bucket = event_time.round(5min)
```

```tql
{
  event_time: 2024-01-15T10:37:42.847621Z,
  event_type: "login",
  hour_bucket: 2024-01-15T11:00:00Z,
  day_bucket: 2024-01-15T00:00:00Z,
  five_min_bucket: 2024-01-15T10:40:00Z,
}
```

### Calculate age from timestamp

```tql
from {
  created_at: 2024-01-01T00:00:00
}
age = now() - created_at
days_old = age.count_days()
hours_old = age.count_hours()
human_readable = f"{days_old.round()} days ago"
```

```tql
{
  created_at: 2024-01-01T00:00:00Z,
  age: 567.7989434994097d,
  days_old: 567.7989434994097,
  hours_old: 13627.174643985833,
  human_readable: "568 days ago",
}
```

### Parse various log timestamps

```tql
from {
  iso: "2024-01-15T10:30:45Z",
  apache: "15/Jan/2024:10:30:45 +0000",
  nginx: "2024/01/15 10:30:45",
  syslog: "Jan 15 10:30:45"
}
// ISO 8601 works with time() directly
iso_time = iso.time()
// Custom formats need parse_time()
apache_time = apache.parse_time("%d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S %z")
nginx_time = nginx.parse_time("%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S")
// For syslog, we need to add the year
syslog_time = ("2024 " + syslog).parse_time("%Y %b %d %H:%M:%S")
```

```tql
{
  iso: "2024-01-15T10:30:45Z",
  apache: "15/Jan/2024:10:30:45 +0000",
  nginx: "2024/01/15 10:30:45",
  syslog: "Jan 15 10:30:45",
  iso_time: 2024-01-15T10:30:45Z,
  apache_time: 2024-01-15T10:30:45Z,
  nginx_time: 2024-01-15T10:30:45Z,
  syslog_time: 2024-01-15T10:30:45Z,
}
```

## Replay and adjust time series

When working with historical data, you often need to replay events with their
original timing or adjust timestamps for analysis. TQL provides two operators
for this: [`delay`](/reference/operators/delay) and
[`timeshift`](/reference/operators/timeshift).

### Adjust timestamps with timeshift

The `timeshift` operator adjusts timestamps to a new baseline while preserving
relative time differences. This is essential when you need to merge datasets
from different time periods into a coherent timeline for comparative analysis.
For example, you might want to overlay security incidents from multiple years
to identify recurring patterns, or align test data from different runs to
compare performance metrics side-by-side.

```tql
from {event: "login", ts: 2020-06-15T09:00:00},
     {event: "action", ts: 2020-06-15T09:05:30},
     {event: "logout", ts: 2020-06-15T17:30:00}
timeshift ts, start=2024-01-01
```

```tql
{event: "login", ts: 2024-01-01T00:00:00Z}
{event: "action", ts: 2024-01-01T00:05:30Z}
{event: "logout", ts: 2024-01-01T08:30:00Z}
```

Notice how the 5.5-minute gap between login and action, and the 8.5-hour
session duration are preserved, but all timestamps now start from January 1, 2024.

You can also scale the time intervals with the `speed` parameter:

```tql
from {event: "start", ts: 2020-01-01T00:00:00},
     {event: "middle", ts: 2020-01-01T00:30:00},
     {event: "end", ts: 2020-01-01T01:00:00}
// Make intervals 10x longer
timeshift ts, start=2024-01-01, speed=0.1
```

```tql
{event: "start", ts: 2024-01-01T00:00:00Z}
{event: "middle", ts: 2024-01-01T05:00:00Z}
{event: "end", ts: 2024-01-01T10:00:00Z}
```

The 30-minute intervals became 5-hour intervals (10x longer with speed=0.1).

### Replay events in real time with delay

The `delay` operator replays events according to their timestamps by
introducing sleep periods between events:

```tql
from {ts: 2024-01-01T00:00:00, msg: "first"},
     {ts: 2024-01-01T00:00:02, msg: "second"},
     {ts: 2024-01-01T00:00:03, msg: "third"}
delay ts, start=now(), speed=0.1
```

With `speed=0.1`, the 2-second gap between first and second events becomes 20
seconds, and the 1-second gap between second and third becomes 10 seconds. This
slower replay makes it easy to observe the delay in action.

For replaying historical data with original timing:

```tql
let $zeek_logs = "https://storage.googleapis.com/tenzir-datasets/M57/zeek-all.log.zst"
from_http $zeek_logs {
  decompress_zstd
  read_zeek_tsv
}
delay ts
```

This replays the logs with real-world inter-arrival times. If an event
occurred at 10:00:00 and the next at 10:00:05, the operator waits 5 seconds
between emitting them.

### Combine with periodic generation

Use [`every`](/reference/operators/every) to generate events periodically, then
replay them with modified timing:

```tql
every 1s {
  from {
    ts: now(),
    message: "Periodic event"
  }
}
head 5
delay ts, speed=0.5
```

This generates events every second but replays them at half speed (2 seconds
between events).

### Practical example: Simulate real-time monitoring

Combine both operators to replay historical logs as if they're happening now:

```tql
// Load historical logs
from_file "/path/to/historical-logs.json"
// Shift timestamps to current time
timeshift timestamp, start=now()
// Replay at 5x speed to quickly review a day's worth of logs
delay timestamp, speed=5.0
// Continue with normal processing
// ...
```

### Key differences

- **`timeshift`**: Instantly adjusts all timestamps without delays
- **`delay`**: Introduces real-time delays between events based on their
  timestamps

Use `timeshift` when you need to analyze historical data with updated
timestamps. Use `delay` when you want to replay events with realistic timing,
such as for testing real-time processing systems or simulating live data
streams.

## Best practices

1. **Use proper types**: Convert strings to time values early in your pipeline
2. **Be consistent**: Standardize timestamp formats across your data
3. **Consider timezones**: Be aware that TQL timestamps are timezone-aware
4. **Round appropriately**: Use rounding to group events into time buckets
5. **Handle null values**: Check for missing timestamps before calculations
