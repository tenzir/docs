Build your own **AI Workbench** by bringing an AI agent and configuring it
according to the guides in this section. Once set up, use it to write TQL
pipelines, understand OCSF schemas, generate parsers, and create data mappings.

## Two ways to get AI assistance

Tenzir offers two integration points for AI agents:

1. **MCP Server**: A [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)
   server that exposes Tenzir functionality as tools. Works with any
   MCP-compatible agent.
2. **Claude Plugins**: [Skills](https://agentskills.io), subagents, slash
   commands, and hooks that integrate deeply with Claude Code.

### Which should you use?

**Claude Code users: install our plugins.** We maintain plugins that encode how
we write TQL, document features, and manage releases. Skills auto-activate based
on context, subagents handle specialized tasks, slash commands provide quick
actions, and hooks automate workflows. This is the recommended experience.

**Other agents with skills support:** The skills specification is open, but
you'd need to port our plugins to your agent's format. We currently only ship
plugins for Claude Code.

**All other agents: use the MCP server.** If your agent doesn't support skills,
the MCP server gives you access to core tools like `make_parser`,
`make_ocsf_mapping`, and `run_pipeline`. Any MCP-compatible agent works with the
server.

## Getting started

<Steps>

1. [Install the MCP server](/guides/ai-workbench/install-mcp-server): Connect
   your AI agent to Tenzir.
2. [Configure your agent](/guides/ai-workbench/configure-your-agent): Optimize
   settings for Tenzir development.
3. [Use Claude plugins](/guides/ai-workbench/use-claude-plugins): Install the
   TQL, OCSF, and Docs plugins for enhanced workflows.
4. [Generate a parser](/guides/ai-workbench/generate-a-parser): Create TQL
   parsers from sample log events.
5. [Generate an OCSF mapping](/guides/ai-workbench/generate-an-ocsf-mapping):
   Map parsed data to the OCSF schema.
