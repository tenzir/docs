description: Access Tenzir documentation as an Agent Skill for any compatible AI agent
---

This guide shows you how to use the Tenzir documentation as an Agent Skill.
You'll learn how to download the skill artifact, understand its structure, and
configure it with your AI agent.

## What is an Agent Skill?

[Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) is an open specification for packaging
knowledge that AI agents can use. Skills provide structured documentation with
progressive disclosure, letting agents load a condensed overview first and drill
into details only when needed.

Tenzir publishes its documentation as an Agent Skill with each release. This
gives any skill-compatible agent immediate access to deployment guides, TQL
reference, operator documentation, and integration examples.

### Comparison with other options

| Integration    | Best for                                    | Setup complexity |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Agent Skills   | Portable documentation for any agent        | Low              |
| MCP Server     | Live pipeline execution and tool calling    | Medium           |
| Claude Plugins | Deep Claude Code integration with workflows | Low              |

Use the Agent Skill when your agent supports the specification but lacks MCP
support, or when you want documentation without executing pipelines.

## Download the skill

Download `tenzir-skill.tar.gz` from the
[latest release](https://github.com/tenzir/docs/releases/latest):

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/tenzir/docs/releases/latest/download/tenzir-skill.tar.gz
tar xzf tenzir-skill.tar.gz
```

This extracts a `tenzir/` directory with the skill contents.

## Skill structure

The skill uses progressive disclosure to optimize context usage:

```
tenzir/
├── SKILL.md        # Condensed sitemap with excerpts (~8,500 tokens)
└── references/     # Full documentation hierarchy
```

**SKILL.md** contains a navigable overview with:

- Section descriptions (Guides, Tutorials, Explanations, Reference, Integrations)
- Category headings with brief descriptions
- Links to full documentation in `references/`

**references/** mirrors the documentation site structure, containing the
complete content of every page. Your agent can follow links from `SKILL.md` to
load specific pages as needed.

Every release is validated in CI using
[skills-ref](https://github.com/agentskills/agentskills/tree/main/skills-ref)
to ensure the skill conforms to the Agent Skills specification.

## Configure your agent

Configuration varies by agent. See the
[Agent Skills integration guide](https://agentskills.io/integrate-skills) for
detailed instructions on adding skills to different AI agents.

The general approach is:

1. Point your agent to the `tenzir/` directory as a skill source
2. The agent reads `SKILL.md` first for an overview
3. When the agent needs details, it follows links into `references/`

### Example: Claude Code custom instructions

Add the skill path to your project's `CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
## Available skills

Load the Tenzir documentation skill from `path/to/tenzir/SKILL.md` when
answering questions about TQL, operators, or Tenzir deployment.
```

### Example: Generic skill loading

If your agent supports the Agent Skills specification, configure it to load
from the extracted directory:

```
skill_path: ./tenzir
```
