title: Configure your agent
description: Optimize your AI agent for working with Tenzir projects
---

After [installing the MCP server](/guides/ai-workbench/install-mcp-server), you can
further optimize your AI agent for Tenzir development workflows. This guide
covers project-level configuration that enhances the development experience.

:::note[Why we recommend Claude Code]
Tenzir uses Claude Code internally and recommends it for TQL development. The
[Tenzir Claude Marketplace](https://github.com/tenzir/claude-plugins) bundles
authoritative procedural knowledge—skills, slash commands, and hooks that encode
how we write code, documentation, and changelogs. Other AI agents can use the
MCP server for basic TQL assistance, but they lack this curated workflow
integration. We support them to give you choice, though team bandwidth limits
what we can maintain out of the box.
:::

## Claude Code

Claude Code supports a [plugin
marketplace](https://docs.claudecode.dev/plugin-marketplace) that provides
custom skills, slash commands, and MCP servers tailored for specific
development workflows. The [Tenzir Claude
Marketplace](https://github.com/tenzir/claude-plugins) includes plugins for TQL development,
documentation writing, and changelog management.

### Team setup

For team projects, configure `.claude/settings.json` to share the marketplace
and plugins with all contributors. When team members trust the project folder,
Claude Code automatically prompts them to enable the configured plugins.

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "mcp__plugin_tql_tenzir",
      "Read",
      "Edit",
      "Write",
      "NotebookEdit",
      "WebFetch",
      "WebSearch",
      "Skill",
      "SlashCommand",
      "ExitPlanMode"
    ]
  },
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "tenzir": {
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "tenzir/claude-plugins"
      }
    }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "tql@tenzir": true,
    "formatter@tenzir": true,
    "git@tenzir": true,
    "changelog@tenzir": true
  }
}
```

:::tip[Bash permissions]
`Bash` is intentionally omitted from the shared configuration. If you want to
allow shell access, add it to your personal `settings.local.json`, which is
typically gitignored:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": ["Bash"]
  }
}
```

### Recommended plugins

For detailed plugin usage with example prompts and workflows, see [Use Claude
Plugins](/guides/ai-workbench/use-claude-plugins).

| Plugin             | Audience   | Description                                        |
| ------------------ | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `tql@tenzir`       | Users      | Write TQL pipelines with live documentation        |
| `ocsf@tenzir`      | Users      | Navigate OCSF schema for event normalization       |
| `docs@tenzir`      | Users      | Query Tenzir documentation interactively           |
| `formatter@tenzir` | Developers | Automatic code formatting using Tenzir guidelines  |
| `git@tenzir`       | Developers | Git workflows with Tenzir-specific commit messages |
| `changelog@tenzir` | Developers | Changelog management following Tenzir conventions  |

## Cursor

Configure the Tenzir MCP server in `.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tenzir": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["tenzir-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

## VS Code with Copilot

VS Code with GitHub Copilot supports MCP servers starting with version 1.102.

### MCP configuration

Create `.vscode/mcp.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "tenzir": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["tenzir-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

### TQL extension

Install the [TQL extension](https://github.com/tenzir/vscode-tql) for syntax
highlighting and language support.

## Zed

[Zed](https://zed.dev) is a high-performance editor with AI integration. Install
the [TQL extension](https://github.com/tenzir/zed-tql) for syntax highlighting.
