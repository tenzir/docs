[Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) as our site framework.

## Local Development

### First-Time Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tenzir/docs.git
   cd docs
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Start development server**:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

4. **View the site**: Browse to `http://localhost:4321/`

The development server includes:

- üî• Hot module reloading for instant updates
- üìù Live Markdown rendering
- üîç Error reporting in the browser

### Production Build

Create and preview a production build:

```bash
# Build the site
pnpm build

# Preview the build
pnpm preview
```

Then browse to `http://localhost:4321/` to view the production site.

:::tip[CI/CD Pipeline]
Production builds are automatically created in CI. Check out our [GitHub
workflow](https://github.com/tenzir/docs/blob/main/.github/workflows/docs.yaml)
for implementation details.

## Link Checking

The documentation includes automated link validation to ensure all internal and external links work correctly:

### Local Link Checking

Before submitting changes, run link checking locally to catch broken links:

```bash
pnpm lint:linkcheck
```

This will build the site with link validation enabled and report any broken links found.

### CI Integration

Link checking runs automatically in our CI pipeline:

- **All builds**: Link validation is enabled for production builds
- **Pull requests**: Link checking runs as part of the lint workflow
- **Scheduled maintenance**: Weekly link checks run every Sunday to catch broken external links

### How It Works

The link checker validates:

- Internal page references (e.g., `/guides/quickstart`)
- Anchor links within pages (e.g., `/reference/operators#aggregate`)
- External URLs (with appropriate timeout and retry logic)
- Relative links between documentation files

### Fixing Broken Links

When the link checker finds issues:

1. **Invalid internal links**: Update the link to point to the correct page path
2. **Missing anchor references**: Ensure the target heading or element exists
3. **Broken external links**: Update URLs or remove outdated references
4. **False positives**: Add exclusions to the `starlightLinksValidator` configuration in `astro.config.mjs`

The link checker will cause builds to fail if broken links are detected, ensuring the documentation maintains high quality.

## Optimize Images

To keep the repository size manageable, always optimize image files _before_
committing them. This is especially important for formats like PNG, which can
contain unnecessary metadata or use inefficient compression.

### PNG Images

We recommend using [pngquant](https://pngquant.org/), a command-line utility
for lossy compression of PNG files. It significantly reduces file size while
preserving image quality.

To compress a PNG file in-place:

```bash
pngquant --ext .png --force --quality=65-80 image.png
```

### JPEG Images

Use [jpegoptim](https://github.com/tjko/jpegoptim), a utility for optimizing
JPEGs without perceptible quality loss:

```bash
jpegoptim --strip-all --max=80 image.jpg
```

Alternatively, you can use [mozjpeg](https://github.com/mozilla/mozjpeg) for
even better compression ratios.

### SVG Images

Use [svgo](https://github.com/svg/svgo), a Node-based tool to optimize SVG files
by removing unnecessary data:

```bash
svgo image.svg
```

This automatically rewrites the file in-place with redundant code removed and
optimized structure.

## Auto-Updated Files

**Important**: Some files in this repository are automatically updated by CI and
should **never** be manually edited. Manual changes to these files will be
overwritten the next time the [update
workflow](https://github.com/tenzir/docs/blob/main/.github/workflows/update.yaml)
runs.

### Automatically Updated Files

The following files are synchronized from upstream repositories:

**Tenzir Node Documentation:**

- `src/content/docs/changelog/node` is generated from individual changelog
  entries
- `src/content/docs/reference/functions` is synced from
  [tenzir/tenzir](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir) at `docs/functions/`
- `src/content/docs/reference/operators` is synced from
  [tenzir/tenzir](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir) at `docs/operators/`
- `src/content/docs/reference/functions.mdx` is generated from individual
  function files
- `src/content/docs/reference/operators.mdx` is generated from individual
  operator files
- `src/sidebar-reference.js` is generated from individual function and operator
  files for programmatic sidebar navigation
- `src/content/apis/openapi.node.yaml` is the API specification for Tenzir Node
  and generated from the node's source code
- `tenzir.yaml.example` is the node's example configuration file

**Tenzir Platform Documentation:**

- `src/content/docs/changelog/platform` is generated from individual changelog
  entries
- `src/content/docs/reference/platform-cli.mdx` is synced from
  [tenzir/platform](https://github.com/tenzir/platform) at `docs/platform-cli.mdx`

### Making Changes to Auto-Updated Content

If you need to update content in these files:

1. **For Functions/Operators**: Make changes in the
   [tenzir/tenzir](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir) repository
2. **For Platform CLI**: Make changes in the
   [tenzir/platform](https://github.com/tenzir/platform) repository
3. **For generation logic**: Modify the scripts in `scripts/` or the update
   workflow

Our CI will automatically prevent pull requests that modify auto-updated files.
If you encounter this error, revert your changes and make them in the
appropriate upstream repository instead.

## Edit Diagrams

We use [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com) as primary tool to create sketches
of architectural diagrams.

When exporting Excalidraw scenes, always **use light mode** and **choose SVG**
as export format, as we have some CSS magic in place that automatically inverts
colors SVGs so that they also look nicely when using dark mode.

Tenzir developers have access to our Excalidraw [Documentation
collection](https://app.excalidraw.com/o/6dBWEFf9h1l/9RErQkL9e2v). For everyone
else, please reach out to us on our [Discord server](/discord) to request
changes to existing SVGs.
