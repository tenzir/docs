## Local Development

### First-Time Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tenzir/docs.git
   cd docs
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Start development server**:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

4. **View the site**: Browse to `http://localhost:4321/`

The development server includes:

- üî• Hot module reloading for instant updates
- üìù Live Markdown rendering
- üîç Error reporting in the browser

### Production Build

Create and preview a production build:

```bash
# Build the site
pnpm build

# Preview the build
pnpm preview
```

Then browse to `http://localhost:4321/` to view the production site.

:::tip[CI/CD Pipeline]
Production builds are automatically created in CI. Check out our [GitHub
workflow](https://github.com/tenzir/docs/blob/main/.github/workflows/docs.yaml)
for implementation details.

## Link Checking

The documentation includes automated link validation to ensure all internal and external links work correctly:

### Local Link Checking

Before submitting changes, run link checking locally to catch broken links:

```bash
pnpm lint:linkcheck
```

This will build the site with link validation enabled and report any broken links found.

### CI Integration

Link checking runs automatically in our CI pipeline:

- **All builds**: Link validation is enabled for production builds
- **Pull requests**: Link checking runs as part of the lint workflow
- **Scheduled maintenance**: Weekly link checks run every Sunday to catch broken external links

### How It Works

The link checker validates:

- Internal page references (e.g., `/guides/quickstart`)
- Anchor links within pages (e.g., `/reference/operators#aggregate`)
- External URLs (with appropriate timeout and retry logic)
- Relative links between documentation files

### Fixing Broken Links

When the link checker finds issues:

1. **Invalid internal links**: Update the link to point to the correct page path
2. **Missing anchor references**: Ensure the target heading or element exists
3. **Broken external links**: Update URLs or remove outdated references
4. **False positives**: Add exclusions to the `starlightLinksValidator` configuration in `astro.config.mjs`

The link checker will cause builds to fail if broken links are detected, ensuring the documentation maintains high quality.

## Optimize Images

To keep the repository size manageable, always optimize image files _before_
committing them. This is especially important for formats like PNG, which can
contain unnecessary metadata or use inefficient compression.

### PNG Images

We recommend using [pngquant](https://pngquant.org/), a command-line utility
for lossy compression of PNG files. It significantly reduces file size while
preserving image quality.

To compress a PNG file in-place:

```bash
pngquant --ext .png --force --quality=65-80 image.png
```

### JPEG Images

Use [jpegoptim](https://github.com/tjko/jpegoptim), a utility for optimizing
JPEGs without perceptible quality loss:

```bash
jpegoptim --strip-all --max=80 image.jpg
```

Alternatively, you can use [mozjpeg](https://github.com/mozilla/mozjpeg) for
even better compression ratios.

### SVG Images

Use [svgo](https://github.com/svg/svgo), a Node-based tool to optimize SVG files
by removing unnecessary data:

```bash
svgo image.svg
```

This automatically rewrites the file in-place with redundant code removed and
optimized structure.

## Auto-Updated Files

**Important**: Some files in this repository are automatically updated by CI and
should **never** be manually edited. Manual changes to these files will be
overwritten the next time the [update
workflow](https://github.com/tenzir/docs/blob/main/.github/workflows/update.yaml)
runs.

### Automatically Updated Files

The following files are synchronized from upstream repositories:

**Tenzir Node Documentation:**

- `src/content/docs/changelog/node` is generated from individual changelog
  entries
- `src/content/docs/reference/functions` is synced from
  [tenzir/tenzir](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir) at `docs/functions/`
- `src/content/docs/reference/operators` is synced from
  [tenzir/tenzir](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir) at `docs/operators/`
- `src/content/docs/reference/functions.mdx` is generated from individual
  function files
- `src/content/docs/reference/operators.mdx` is generated from individual
  operator files
- `src/content/apis/openapi.node.yaml` is the API specification for Tenzir Node
  and generated from the node's source code
- `tenzir.yaml.example` is the node's example configuration file

**Tenzir Platform Documentation:**

- `src/content/docs/changelog/platform` is generated from individual changelog
  entries
- `src/content/docs/reference/platform-cli.mdx` is synced from
  [tenzir/platform](https://github.com/tenzir/platform) at `docs/platform-cli.mdx`

### Making Changes to Auto-Updated Content

If you need to update content in these files:

1. **For Functions/Operators**: Make changes in the
   [tenzir/tenzir](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir) repository
2. **For Platform CLI**: Make changes in the
   [tenzir/platform](https://github.com/tenzir/platform) repository
3. **For generation logic**: Modify the scripts in `scripts/` or the update
   workflow

Our CI will automatically prevent pull requests that modify auto-updated files.
If you encounter this error, revert your changes and make them in the
appropriate upstream repository instead.

## Edit Diagrams

We use [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com) as primary tool to create sketches
of architectural diagrams.

When exporting Excalidraw scenes, always **use light mode** and **choose SVG**
as export format, as we have some CSS magic in place that automatically inverts
colors SVGs so that they also look nicely when using dark mode.

Tenzir developers have access to our Excalidraw [Documentation
collection](https://app.excalidraw.com/o/6dBWEFf9h1l/9RErQkL9e2v). For everyone
else, please reach out to us on our [Discord server](/discord) to request
changes to existing SVGs.

## Writing Style and Formatting

This section covers the editorial and technical standards for contributing to
the Tenzir documentation.

### Writing Guidelines

We follow the [Google Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style) for
clear and consistent technical documentation. Most notably:

- Use **active voice** in general.
- Avoid anthropomorphic language‚Äîdon't attribute human qualities to software or
  hardware.
- Include definite and indefinite articles (a, an, and the) in your writing.
  Don't skip articles for brevity, including in headings and titles.
- In document titles and headings, use **sentence case**. Capitalize only the
  first word in the title, the first word in a subheading after a colon, and
  any proper nouns or other terms that are always capitalized a certain way.
- Capitalize product names.
- Write documentation in an **informal tone**‚Äîuse common two-word contractions
  such as "you're," "don't," and "there's."
- **Define technical terms and acronyms** on first use. Don't assume readers
  know specialized vocabulary.
- **Put the most important information first**. Don't bury key details in the
  middle of paragraphs.
- **Use consistent terminology** throughout. Don't use different words for the
  same concept (e.g., don't alternate between "node" and "instance").
- **Avoid unclear pronouns** like "it," "this," or "that" without clear
  antecedents. Be explicit about what you're referring to.
- **Choose strong, specific verbs** over weak ones. Use "use" instead of
  "utilize," "help" instead of "facilitate," and "show" instead of
  "demonstrate."
- **Eliminate redundant phrases**. Write "to" instead of "in order to," "now"
  instead of "at this point in time," and "because" instead of "due to the
  fact that."
- **Avoid vague qualifiers** like "simply," "just," "easily," or "obviously."
  These don't add clarity and may frustrate readers who find the task
  difficult.
- **Provide context** for why something matters. Don't just explain what to do‚Äî
  explain when and why to do it.
- **Use hyperlinks judiciously**. Link to external tools, products, or
  resources when first mentioned, but avoid overlinking within the same
  document.

### Formatting Standards

Follow these conventions to maintain consistency across all documentation files.

#### General

- Every file must end with a newline character, but avoid empty lines at the
  end of a file.

#### Markdown Content

- Break lines at **80 characters**.
- When editing Markdown, run `pnpm lint:markdown:fix` and `pnpm
lint:prettier:fix` when you're done.

#### Code

- Avoid empty lines within functions.
- When editing source code (`.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.astro` files), run
  `pnpm lint:eslint:fix` when you're done.
