## Local Development

### First-Time Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tenzir/docs.git
   cd docs
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. **Start development server**:

   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```

4. **View the site**: Browse to `http://localhost:4321/`

The development server includes:

- 🔥 Hot module reloading for instant updates
- 📝 Live Markdown rendering
- 🔍 Error reporting in the browser

### Production Build

Create and preview a production build:

```bash
# Build the site
bun run build

# Preview the build
bun run preview
```

Then browse to `http://localhost:4321/` to view the production site.

:::tip[CI/CD Pipeline]
Production builds are automatically created in CI. Check out our [GitHub
workflow](https://github.com/tenzir/docs/blob/main/.github/workflows/docs.yaml)
for implementation details.

## Link Checking

The documentation includes automated link validation to ensure all internal and external links work correctly:

### Local Link Checking

Before submitting changes, run link checking locally to catch broken links:

```bash
bun run build:linkcheck
```

This will build the site with link validation enabled and report any broken links found.

### CI Integration

Link checking runs automatically in our CI pipeline:

- **All builds**: Link validation is enabled for production builds
- **Pull requests**: Link checking runs as part of the lint workflow
- **Scheduled maintenance**: Weekly link checks run every Sunday to catch broken external links

### How It Works

The link checker validates:

- Internal page references (e.g., `/guides/quickstart`)
- Anchor links within pages (e.g., `/reference/operators#aggregate`)
- External URLs (with appropriate timeout and retry logic)
- Relative links between documentation files

### Fixing Broken Links

When the link checker finds issues:

1. **Invalid internal links**: Update the link to point to the correct page path
2. **Missing anchor references**: Ensure the target heading or element exists
3. **Broken external links**: Update URLs or remove outdated references
4. **False positives**: Add exclusions to the `starlightLinksValidator` configuration in `astro.config.mjs`

The link checker will cause builds to fail if broken links are detected, ensuring the documentation maintains high quality.

## Optimize Images

To keep the repository size manageable, always optimize image files _before_
committing them. This is especially important for formats like PNG, which can
contain unnecessary metadata or use inefficient compression.

### PNG Images

We recommend using [pngquant](https://pngquant.org/), a command-line utility
for lossy compression of PNG files. It significantly reduces file size while
preserving image quality.

To compress a PNG file in-place:

```bash
pngquant --ext .png --force --quality=65-80 image.png
```

### JPEG Images

Use [jpegoptim](https://github.com/tjko/jpegoptim), a utility for optimizing
JPEGs without perceptible quality loss:

```bash
jpegoptim --strip-all --max=80 image.jpg
```

Alternatively, you can use [mozjpeg](https://github.com/mozilla/mozjpeg) for
even better compression ratios.

### SVG Images

Use [svgo](https://github.com/svg/svgo), a Node-based tool to optimize SVG files
by removing unnecessary data:

```bash
svgo image.svg
```

This automatically rewrites the file in-place with redundant code removed and
optimized structure.

## Edit Diagrams

We use [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com) as primary tool to create sketches
of architectural diagrams.

### Creating New Diagrams

For new diagrams, save the `.excalidraw` source file directly in the content
directory alongside your markdown:

1. Create your diagram in Excalidraw (use light mode)
2. Save as `diagram-name.excalidraw` in the same directory as your markdown file
3. Reference it in markdown: `![Alt text](diagram-name.excalidraw)`
4. Run `bun run generate:excalidraw` to generate the SVG

The build process converts `.excalidraw` files to `.excalidraw.svg` and inlines
them directly into the HTML. This enables automatic dark mode support via CSS.

Generated `.excalidraw.svg` files are gitignored—only the `.excalidraw` source
files are tracked.

:::caution[Don't commit exported SVGs]
Always commit `.excalidraw` source files, not exported SVGs. Source files are
editable, diffable, and the build generates optimized SVGs automatically.
:::

:::tip[AI-assisted diagramming]
Our [Excalidraw Claude plugin](https://github.com/tenzir/claude-plugins/tree/main/plugins/excalidraw)
enables Claude to create and edit `.excalidraw` files directly. This is useful
for generating diagrams from descriptions or making quick edits without leaving
your editor.
:::

### Editing Existing SVGs

Some older diagrams exist only as exported SVGs. When exporting Excalidraw
scenes manually, always **use light mode** and **choose SVG** as export format,
as we have CSS in place that automatically inverts colors so diagrams look nice
in dark mode.

Tenzir developers have access to our Excalidraw [Documentation
collection](https://app.excalidraw.com/o/6dBWEFf9h1l/9RErQkL9e2v). For everyone
else, please reach out to us on our [Discord server](/discord) to request
changes to existing SVGs.

## Writing Style and Formatting

This section covers the editorial and technical standards for contributing to
the Tenzir documentation.

### Writing Guidelines

We follow the [Google Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style) for
clear and consistent technical documentation. Most notably:

- Use **active voice** in general.
- Avoid anthropomorphic language—don't attribute human qualities to software or
  hardware.
- Include definite and indefinite articles (a, an, and the) in your writing.
  Don't skip articles for brevity, including in headings and titles.
- In document titles and headings, use **sentence case**. Capitalize only the
  first word in the title, the first word in a subheading after a colon, and
  any proper nouns or other terms that are always capitalized a certain way.
- Capitalize product names.
- Write documentation in an **informal tone**—use common two-word contractions
  such as "you're," "don't," and "there's."
- **Define technical terms and acronyms** on first use. Don't assume readers
  know specialized vocabulary.
- **Put the most important information first**. Don't bury key details in the
  middle of paragraphs.
- **Use consistent terminology** throughout. Don't use different words for the
  same concept (e.g., don't alternate between "node" and "instance").
- **Avoid unclear pronouns** like "it," "this," or "that" without clear
  antecedents. Be explicit about what you're referring to.
- **Choose strong, specific verbs** over weak ones. Use "use" instead of
  "utilize," "help" instead of "facilitate," and "show" instead of
  "demonstrate."
- **Eliminate redundant phrases**. Write "to" instead of "in order to," "now"
  instead of "at this point in time," and "because" instead of "due to the
  fact that."
- **Avoid vague qualifiers** like "simply," "just," "easily," or "obviously."
  These don't add clarity and may frustrate readers who find the task
  difficult.
- **Provide context** for why something matters. Don't just explain what to do—
  explain when and why to do it.
- **Use hyperlinks judiciously**. Link to external tools, products, or
  resources when first mentioned, but avoid overlinking within the same
  document.

### Formatting Standards

Follow these conventions to maintain consistency across all documentation files.

#### General

- Every file must end with a newline character, but avoid empty lines at the
  end of a file.

#### Markdown Content

- Break lines at **80 characters**.
- When editing Markdown, run `bun run lint:markdown:fix` and `bun run
lint:prettier:fix` when you're done.

#### Code

- Avoid empty lines within functions.
- When editing source code (`.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.astro` files), run
  `bun run lint:biome:fix` when you're done.
