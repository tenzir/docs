The Tenzir documentation resides at https://github.com/tenzir/docs.
We use [Astro](https://astro.build) with
[Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) as website framework.

## Develop and view locally

Install web framework dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Build a development version of the docs:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Then browse to http://localhost:4321/ to view the site.

## Build for production

Create a production build as follows:

```bash
pnpm build
```

Preview the generated files by spinning up a web server:

```bash
pnpm preview
```

Then browse to http://localhost:4321/ to view the site.

We create a production build in CI. Check out our [GitHub
workflow](https://github.com/tenzir/docs/blob/main/.github/workflows/docs.yaml)
for the gory details.

## Edit diagrams

We use [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com) as primary tool to create sketches
of architectural diagrams.

When exporting Excalidraw scenes, always **use light mode** and **choose SVG**
as export format, as we have some CSS magic in place that automatically inverts
colors SVGs so that they also look nicely when using dark mode.

Tenzir developers have access to our Exalidraw [Documentation
collection](https://app.excalidraw.com/o/6dBWEFf9h1l/9RErQkL9e2v). For everyone
else, we encourage to reach out to us on our [Discord server](/discord) to
request changes to existing SVGs.
