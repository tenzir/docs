title: Coding Style
---

This page documents the coding style for the languages we use.

## Documentation

When documenting bugs, deficiencies, future tasks, or noteworthy things in the
code, we use two keywords that most editors and tools recognize: `FIXME:` and
`TODO:`. We use `FIXME` for a _known bug_ and `TODO` for everything else. The
subsequent `:` is important for tooling, such as syntax highlighters. Here are
two examples:

```cpp
// FIXME: this currently fails on FreeBSD.
// FIXME: this algorithms is broken for i < 0.
```

A typical `TODO` could be:

```python
# TODO: refactor this code to separate mechanism from policy.
# TODO: add another argument to process user-defined tags.
```

## EditorConfig

- Some projects in the Tenzir organization provide `.editorconfig` files. Please
  respect the settings defined in these. For many editors, plugins exist to
  automatically apply EditorConfig files.

## Scripting Languages

- Scripts are executables (`chmod +x path/to/your-script`) and words in
  their names are separated using dashes (`your-script` over `your_script`).

- The first line of a script should be a shebang, e.g., `'#!/bin/sh'` or
  `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.

- The second line is empty.

- Starting at the third line, write a comment detailing usage instructions, and
  a short and concise description of the script.

### Shell Scripts

- Prefer to use POSIX sh when possible.

- Tenzir uses [ShellCheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck) for linting.
  Pull request review feedback for shell scripts is in parts based on ShellCheck.

### Python

- We use Python 3, with no special restrictions for newer features. Specify the
  minimum required version in the shebang, e.g. `#!/usr/bin/env python3.6`.

- Use [black](https://github.com/psf/black) for linting. Black is a heavily
  opinionated tool for both formatting and linting, and we found its opinion to
  be a good standard for us to use.

## Web Development

- All web-based projects in the Tenzir organization define style checkers and
  linters in their respective configuration files, so they are automatically
  applied.

## CMake

CMake is the build scaffold of Tenzir.

### General

- Prefer targets and properties over variables.

- Don't use global _include_directories_.

- Export consumable targets to both build and install directories.

- Assign sensible export names for your targets, the `tenzir::` namespace is
  implicitly prefixed.

### Formatting

- The cmake files are formatted with
  [cmake-format](https://github.com/cheshirekow/cmake_format).

## C++

Tenzir's core is written in C++. We follow a style based on STL, [Google
style][google-style], and [CAF style][caf-style] guidelines.

[google-style]: http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml
[caf-style]: https://github.com/actor-framework/actor-framework/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

### General

- Minimize vertical whitespace within functions. Use comments to separate
  logical code blocks.

- The `const` keyword precedes the type, e.g., `const T&` as opposed to
  `T const&`.

- `*` and `&` bind to the _type_, e.g., `T* arg` instead of `T *arg`.

- When declaring variables and functions, provide the [storage class
  specifier] (`extern`, `static`, `thread_local`, `mutable`) first, followed
  by the [declaration specifiers] in order of `friend`, `inline`, `virtual`,
  `explicit`, `constexpr`, `consteval`, and `constinit`.

[storage class specifier]: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/storage_duration
[declaration specifiers]: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/declarations#Specifiers

- Always use `auto` to declare a variable unless you cannot initialize it
  immediately or if you actually want a type conversion. In the latter case,
  provide a comment why this conversion is necessary.

- Never use unwrapped, manual resource management such as `new` and `delete`.

- Never use `typedef`; always write `using T = X` in favor of `typedef X T`.

- Keywords are always followed by a whitespace: `if (...)`, `template <...>`,
  `while (...)`, etc.

- Do not add whitespace when negating an expression with `!`:

  ```cpp
  if (!sunny())
    stay_home()
  ```

- Opening braces belong onto the same line:

  ```cpp
  struct foo {
    void f() {
    }
  };
  ```

- Use inline functions for trivial code, such as getters/setters or
  straight-forward logic that does not span more than 3 lines.

### Header

- Header filenames end in `.hpp` and implementation filenames in `.cpp`.

- All header files should use `#pragma once` to prevent multiple inclusion.

- Don't use `#include` when a forward declarations suffices. It can make sense
  to outsource forward declarations into a separate file per module. The file
  name should be `<MODULE>/fwd.h`.

- Include order is from high-level to low-level headers, e.g.,

  ```cpp
  // iff a matching header exists
  #include "tenzir/matching_header.hpp"

  #include "tenzir/logger.hpp"

  #include <3rd/party.hpp>

  #include <memory>

  #include <sys/types.h>
  ```

  `clang-format` is configured to automatically change the include order
  accordingly. Includes separated by preprocessor directives need to be sorted
  manually.

  Within each section, the order should be alphabetical. Tenzir includes should
  always be in double quotes and relative to the source directory, whereas
  system-wide includes in angle brackets. See below for an example on how to
  structure includes in unit tests.

- As in the standard library, the order of parameters when declaring a function
  is: inputs, then outputs. API coherence and symmetry trumps this rule, e.g.,
  when the first argument of related functions model the same concept.

### Classes

- Use the order `public`, `protected`, `private` for functions and members in
  classes.

- Mark single-argument constructors as `explicit` to avoid implicit conversions;
  use `explicit(false)` to indicate that a non-explicit constructor is
  intentional.

- The order of member functions within a class is: constructors, operators,
  mutating members, accessors.

- Friends first: put friend declaration immediate after opening the class.

- Put declarations (and/or definitions) of assignment operators right after the
  constructors, and all other operators at the bottom of the public section.

- Use structs for state-less classes or when the API is the struct's state.

- Prefer types with value semantics over reference semantics.

- Use the [rule of zero or rule of
  five](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/rule_of_three).

- When providing a move constructor and move-assignment operator, declare them
  as `noexcept`.

- Use brace-initialization for member construction when possible. Only use
  parenthesis-initialization to avoid calling a `std::initializer_list`
  overload.

### Naming

- Class names, constants, and function names are lowercase with underscores.

- Template parameter types should be written in CamelCase.

- Types and variables should be nouns, while functions performing an action
  should be "command" verbs. Getter and setter functions should be nouns. We do
  not use an explicit `get_` or `set_` prefix. Classes used to implement
  metaprogramming functions also should use verbs, e.g., `remove_const`.

- All library macros should start with `TENZIR_` to avoid potential clashes with
  external libraries.

- Names of (i) classes/structs, (ii) functions, and (iii) enums should be
  lower case and delimited by underscores.

- Put non-API implementation into namespace `detail`.

- Member variables have an underscore (`_`) as suffix, unless they constitute
  the public interface. Getters and setters use the same member name without
  the suffix.

- Put static non-const variables in an anonymous namespace.

- Name generic temporary or input variables `x`, `y`, and `z`. If such
  variables represent a collection of elements, use their plural form `xs`,
  `ys`, and `zs`.

- Prefix counter variables with `num_`.

- If a function has a return value, use `result` as variable name.

### Breaking

- Break constructor initializers after the comma, use two spaces for
  indentation, and place each initializer on its own line (unless you don't
  need to break at all):

  ```cpp
  my_class::my_class()
    : my_base_class{some_function()},
      greeting_{"Hello there! This is my_class!"},
      some_bool_flag_{false} {
    // ok
  }

  other_class::other_class() : name_{"tommy"}, buddy_{"michael"} {
    // ok
  }
  ```

- Break function arguments after the comma for both declaration and invocation:

  ```cpp
  a_rather_long_return_type f(const std::string& x,
                              const std::string& y) {
    // ...
  }
  ```

  If that turns out intractable, break directly after the opening parenthesis:

  ```cpp
  template <typename T>
  black_hole_space_time_warp f(
    typename const T::gravitational_field_manager& manager,
    typename const T::antimatter_clustear& cluster) {
    // ...
  }
  ```

- Break template parameters without indentation:

  ```cpp
  template <class T>
  auto identity(T x) {
    return x;
  }
  ```

- Break trailining return types without indentation if they cannot fit on the
  same line:

  ```cpp
  template <class T>
  auto compute_upper_bound_on_compressed_data(T x)
  -> std::enable_if_t<std::is_integral_v<T>, T> {
    return detail::bound(x);
  }
  ```

- Break before binary and ternary operators:

  ```cpp
  if (today_is_a_sunny_day()
      && it_is_not_too_hot_to_go_swimming()) {
    // ...
  }
  ```

### Template Metaprogramming

- Use the `typename` keyword only to access dependent types. For general
  template parameters, use `class` instead:

  ```cpp
  template <class T>
  struct foo {
    using type = typename T::type;
  };
  ```

- Use `T` for generic, unconstrained template parameters and `x` for generic
  function arguments. Suffix both with `s` for template parameter packs:

  ```cpp
  template <class T, class... Ts>
  auto f(T x, Ts... xs) {
    // ...
  }
  ```

- Break `using name = ...` statements always directly after `=` if they do not
  fit in one line.

- Use one level of indentation per "open" template and place the closing `>`,
  `>::type` or `>::value` on its own line. For example:

  ```cpp
  using optional_result_type =
    typename std::conditional<
      std::is_same<result_type, void>::value,
      bool,
      optional<result_type>
    >::type;
  ```

- When dealing with "ordinary" templates, use indentation based on the position
  of the last opening `<`:

  ```cpp
  using type = quite_a_long_template_which_needs_a_break<std::string,
                                                         double>;
  ```

- When adding new type traits, also provide `*_t` and/or `*_v` helpers:

  ```cpp
  template <class T>
  using my_trait_t = typename my_trait<T>::type;

  template <class T>
  constexpr auto my_trait_v = my_trait<T>::value;
  ```

### Logging

- Available log levels are `ERROR`, `WARN`, `INFO`, `VERBOSE`, `DEBUG` and
  `TRACE`.

- Messages can be sent by using the `TENZIR_<level>` macros.

- Try to restrict usage of the `TENZIR_INFO` message type to the main actors.
  Info is the chattiest level that most users will see, so it should require
  no or only little understanding of Tenzir's system architecture for the
  reader to understand.

- Use the `TENZIR_TRACE_SCOPE` macro to elicit an additional message at the exit
  of the current scope. The trace level can be used to create a trace of the
  call stack with fine grained control over its depth. Since the size of trace
  messages can quickly go out of hand, omit trace messages from helper functions
  and generic algorithm implementations.

### Comments

- Doxygen comments start with `///`.

- Use Markdown instead of Doxygen formatters.

- Use `@cmd` rather than `\cmd`.

- Document pre- and post-conditions with `@pre` and `@post` (where appropriate).

- Reference other parameters with emphasis:

  ```cpp
  /// @param x A number between 0 and 1.
  /// @param y Scales *x* by a constant factor.
  ```

- Use `@tparam` to document template parameters.

- For simple getters or obvious functions returning a value, use a one-line
  `@returns` statement:

  ```cpp
  /// @returns The answer.
  int f();
  ```

- Use `//` or `/*` and `*/` to define basic comments that should not be
  swallowed by Doxygen.

### External Files

When integrating 3rd-party code into the code base, use the following scaffold:

```cpp
//    _   _____   __________
//   | | / / _ | / __/_  __/     Visibility
//   | |/ / __ |_\ \  / /          Across
//   |___/_/ |_/___/ /_/       Space and Time

### Unit Tests

- Every new feature must come with unit tests.

- The filename and path should mirror the component under test. For example,
  the component `tenzir/detail/feature.hpp` should have a test file called
  `test/detail/feature.cpp`.

- The include order in unit tests resembles the order for standard headers,
  except that unit test includes and the suite definition comes at the top.

- Make judicious use of _fixtures_ for prepping your test environment.

- The snippet below illustrates a simple example for a new component
  `tenzir/foo.hpp` that would go into `test/foo.cpp`.

  ```cpp
  //    _   _____   __________
  //   | | / / _ | / __/_  __/     Visibility
  //   | |/ / __ |_\ \  / /          Across
  //   |___/_/ |_/___/ /_/       Space and Time
  //

  using namespace tenzir;

  namespace {

  struct fixture {
    fixture() {
      // Setup
      context = 42;
    }

    ~fixture() {
      // Teardown
      context = 0;
    }

    int context;
  };

  } // namespace <anonymous>

  FIXTURE_SCOPE(foo_tests, fixture)

  TEST(construction) {
    MESSAGE("default construction");
    foo x;
    MESSAGE("assignment");
    x = 42;
    CHECK_EQUAL(x, context);
  }

  FIXTURE_SCOPE_END()
  ```

### Continuous Integration

We use GitHub Actions to build and test each commit. Merging a pull request
requires that all checks pass for the latest commit in the branch. GitHub
displays the status of the individual checks in the pull request.

### Code Coverage

The GitHub Actions workflow [Analysis][analysis-workflow] contains a _Code
Coverage_ job that runs unit tests for libtenzir and bundled plugins, and
integration tests for Tenzir with bundled plugins to create a detailed line
coverage report. The CI creates and uploads reports as an artifact in the
Analysis workflow as part of every pull request and for every merge to master.

In addition to the local report, the workflow uploads the coverage report to
[Codecov][codecov-tenzir], which offers a visual interface for seeing coverage
changes introduced by code changes:

[![Codecov Report][codecov-grid]][codecov-tenzir]

Each block represents a single file in the project. The size and color of each
block is represented by the number of statements and the coverage,
respectively.

Codecov offers also a [sunburst][codecov-sunburst] and [icicle][codecov-icicle]
graph, visualizing the same data with a different approach.

To generate a coverage report locally, create a new Debug build of Tenzir with
the CMake option `-D TENZIR_ENABLE_CODE_COVERAGE=ON` and run the `ccov` build
target. This creates a coverage report in `<path/to/build-dir>/ccov`.
