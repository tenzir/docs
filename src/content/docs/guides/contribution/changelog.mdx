title: Changelog
---

We maintain automatically generated [changelog](../../../changelog) with
*user-facing* change descriptions.

The source for this generated page is a set of Markdown files in the
[`/changelog`](https://github.com/tenzir/docs/tree/main/changelog) directory of
our docs repo. There exists a directory for `node` and `platform` with the
following structure:

import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<FileTree>
- changelog
  - node
    - next
      - 2uwQMJ50ob7ijy9NS9XdWh5yfsc.md
      - 2uwQnMTpRSDe8bB0mJXFkyujped.md
    - v5.0.0
      - some-feature.md
  - platform
    - next
      - 2uwac8f6MEARnzJ9mORKqtm9pwA.md
</FileTree>

Each product (`node`, `platform`) has subdirectories for each version (e.g.,
`v5.0.0`), with `next` referring to the currently unreleased version
accumulating changes on the main branch. Within each version directory exists a
set of `.md` files representing individual changelog entries.

## Write a changelog entry

To add an entry to the changelog, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the correct directory:** Go into the `changelog/` directory,
   then the appropriate product subdirectory (`node` or `platform`), and finally
   the version subdirectory corresponding to the release your change will be
   part of. For changes currently on the `main` branch that haven't been
   released yet, use the `next` directory.

   - Example: A feature for the upcoming Node release goes into
      `changelog/node/next/`.
   - Example: A bug fix for Platform v1.2.0 would go into
      `changelog/platform/v1.2.0/`.

2. **Create a new Markdown file:** Create a new file ending in `.md`. While the
   exact filename doesn't impact the final output (our examples use IDs), using
   a descriptive name can be helpful (e.g., `add-frobnication-widget.md`).

3. **Add Frontmatter and Content:** Each file must start with YAML frontmatter,
   followed by the Markdown description of the change.

    ```markdown
    ---
    title: "Add Frobnication Widget" # Required: Short title for the entry
    type: feature                    # Required: One of 'feature', 'change', 'bugfix'
    authors: [alice, bob]            # Optional: GitHub username(s) (or use 'author')
    prs: [101, 105]                  # Optional: GitHub PR number(s) (or use 'pr')
    ---

    Users can now frobnicate widgets directly from the dashboard. This enhances
    workflow efficiency by providing direct access...
    ```

4. **Fill in the Frontmatter Fields:**
   - `title` (*Required*): A concise title describing the change. This will
     appear as a heading (`###`) in the generated changelog.
   - `type` (*Required*): The category of the change. This determines which
     section the entry appears under ("Features", "Changes", or "Bug Fixes").
     Must be one of:
       - `feature`: For new functionality.
       - `change`: For modifications to existing functionality.
       - `bugfix`: For bug fixes.
   - `authors` / `author` (*Required*): The GitHub username(s) of the author(s).
     You can provide a single username as a string or multiple usernames as a
     YAML list (`[user1, user2]`). You can use either the key `author` or
     `authors` for a single author, but prefer `authors` for lists. **Do not use
     both `author` and `authors` in the same file**, as this will cause an
     error. The script generates links like `[@username](...)`.
   - `prs` / `pr` (*Optional*): The relevant GitHub Pull Request number(s). You
     can provide a single number or multiple numbers as a YAML list (`[123,
     456]`). You can use either `pr` or `prs` for a single PR number, but prefer
     `prs` for lists. **Do not use both `pr` and `prs` in the same file**, as
     this will cause an error. The script generates links like `[#123](...)`.

5. **Write the Description:** Below the closing `---` of the frontmatter, write
   the description of the change using Markdown.
   - **Focus on the user:** Explain the change from a user's perspective. What
     is the impact? How does it affect usage?
   - Be clear and concise.
   - You can use standard Markdown formatting (lists, code blocks, links,
      etc.).

6. **Commit and Push:** Commit the new `.md` file to the appropriate branch
   (usually `main` for `next` entries, or a release branch if backporting).

## Automation

Once a change involving files in the `/changelog` directory is pushed to the
`main` branch, a GitHub Actions workflow automatically executes the
`changelog.py` script. This script performs the following actions:

- Aggregates all `.md` entries for each product and version.
- Generates the corresponding versioned `.mdx` pages (e.g.,
  `mdx/changelog/node/next.mdx`, `mdx/changelog/node/v5-0-0.mdx`).
- Generates/updates the `index.mdx` file within each product's changelog
  directory (e.g., `mdx/changelog/node/index.mdx`) with sorted links to the
  version pages.
- Generates/updates the TypeScript sidebar file (`sidebar-changelog.ts` by
  default, if the `--sidebar-file` flag is used).
- Commits these generated/updated files back to the `main` branch with a `[skip
  ci]` message.

The deployed documentation site will then reflect these updated changelog pages.
