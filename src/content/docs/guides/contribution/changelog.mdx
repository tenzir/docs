title: Changelog
---

We maintain automatically generated [changelog pages](../../../changelog/) with
*user-facing* change descriptions for Tenzir Node and Tenzir Platform.

The source for these generated pages is a set of Markdown files located within
the [`/changelog`](https://github.com/tenzir/docs/tree/main/changelog)
directory of this repository.

import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<FileTree>
- changelog
  - node
    - next
      - some-feature.md
      - another-change.md
    - v5.0.0
      - important-fix.md
  - platform
    - next
      - initial-entry.md
</FileTree>

Each product (`node`, `platform`) has subdirectories for each version (e.g.,
`v5.0.0`), with `next` referring to the currently unreleased version
accumulating changes on the main branch. Within each version directory exists a
set of `.md` files representing individual changelog entries.

## Changelog Entry Format

Each individual changelog entry must be a Markdown file (`.md`) structured with
YAML frontmatter followed by the description of the change.

A changelog has the following structure:

```markdown
---
title: Concise Title of the Change  # Required
type: feature                       # Required: 'feature', 'change', or 'bugfix'
authors: [github_username]          # Required: GitHub username(s) (or use 'author')
prs: [1234]                         # Optional: GitHub PR number(s) (or use 'pr')
---

Detailed description of the change using Markdown, focusing on the user impact.
Explain what changed, why, and how users might interact with it.
```

The frontmatter supports these fields:

- `title` (**Required**): A concise title describing the change. This will
    appear as a heading (`###`) in the generated changelog page for that
    version.
- `type` (**Required**): The category of the change. This determines which
    section the entry appears under ("Features", "Changes", or "Bug Fixes").
    Must be one of:
       - `feature`: For new functionality.
       - `change`: For modifications to existing functionality.
       - `bugfix`: For bug fixes.
- `authors` / `author` (**Required**): The GitHub username(s) of the
    author(s). Provide a single username as a string or multiple usernames as a
    YAML list (`[user1, user2]`). You can use either `author` or `authors` for
    a single author, but prefer `authors` for lists. **Do not use both `author`
    and `authors` in the same file**, as this will cause an error. The script
    generates links like `[@username](...)`.
- `prs` / `pr` (Optional): The relevant GitHub Pull Request number(s). Provide
    a single number or multiple numbers as a YAML list (`[123, 456]`). You can
    use either `pr` or `prs` for a single PR number, but prefer `prs` for
    lists. **Do not use both `pr` and `prs` in the same file**, as this will
    cause an error. The script generates links like `[#123](...)` for products
    configured with a `pr_base_url` (currently enabled for `node`).

Below the closing `---` of the frontmatter, write the description using standard
Markdown. **Focus on the user:** Explain the change from their perspective. What
is the impact? How does it affect usage or behavior? Examples go a long way. Be
clear and concise.

## Adding an Entry Manually

If you have written a changelog entry file (`.md`) according to the format
above, here's how to add it to the `tenzir/docs` repository:

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Steps>

1. **Clone the Repository:** If you haven't already, clone the `tenzir/docs`
   repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:tenzir/docs.git
   cd docs
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Correct Directory:** Change into the appropriate product and
   version subdirectory within the `changelog/` directory. Use `next` for
   unreleased changes going into the next version.
    - Example (Upcoming Node feature): `cd changelog/node/next/`
    - Example (Platform v1.2.0 fix): `cd changelog/platform/v1.2.0/`
3. **Place Your File:** Copy or move your new `.md` changelog entry file into
   this directory.
4. **Commit and Push:** Stage the new file, commit it, and push it to the `main`
   branch (or the relevant branch if targeting a specific release).
    ```bash
    git add <your-changelog-file>.md
    git commit -m "Add changelog entry for <brief description>"
    git push origin main
    ```

</Steps>

## Adding an Entry via CI from another Repository

Changelog entries related to changes in other repositories (like
`tenzir/tenzir`) can be automatically added to this `docs` repository via GitHub
Actions in the *source* repository.

The CI workflow in the source repository (e.g., `tenzir/tenzir`) needs to
perform these general steps:

<Steps>

1. **Generate Entry:** Create the content of the `.md` changelog file
   (frontmatter + description) based on the change (e.g., from PR metadata).
   Ensure it follows the [Changelog Entry Format](#changelog-entry-format).
2. **Checkout `docs` Repo:** Use `actions/checkout` to check out the
   `tenzir/docs` repository into a separate path. This requires a token or
   deploy key with write permissions to `tenzir/docs`, stored as a secret in the
   source repository.
3. **Create File:** Create the new `.md` file within the checked-out `docs`
   repository structure at the correct path
   (`changelog/<product>/<version>/<filename>.md`). The `<version>` should
   typically be `next`.
4. **Commit and Push:** Use `git` commands within the workflow to:
    - Configure the git user (`user.name`, `user.email`).
    - Stage the newly created file (`git add`).
    - Commit the file (`git commit -m "Add changelog for <feature/fix> from <source-repo> [skip ci]"`).
      Remember to include `[skip ci]` in the commit message to prevent CI loops.
    - Push the commit to the `main` branch of `tenzir/docs`.

</Steps>

For a concrete example of checking out and pushing to the `docs` repository
using a secret token, refer to the [`Documentation`
workflow](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/blob/main/.github/workflows/documentation.yaml)
within the `tenzir/tenzir` repository.

## Publishing Process

Once a new changelog entry (`.md` file) lands on the `main` branch of the
`tenzir/docs` repository, whether added manually or via CI from another repo, a
GitHub Actions workflow  executes the `changelog.py` script located in the
`/changelog` directory. The script performs the following actions:

<Steps>

1. Aggregates all `.md` entries for each product and version.
2. Generates the corresponding versioned `.mdx` pages within the
   `mdx/changelog/` directory (e.g., `mdx/changelog/node/next.mdx`,
   `mdx/changelog/node/v5-0-0.mdx`). The output directory can be configured via
   the `--output-dir` flag (defaulting to `mdx`).
3. Generates or updates the `index.mdx` file within each product's generated
   changelog directory (e.g., `mdx/changelog/node/index.mdx`) with sorted
   links to the version pages.
4. If the `--sidebar-file` flag is used in the workflow, it generates or
   updates the specified TypeScript sidebar file (defaulting to
   `sidebar-changelog.ts`).
5. Commits these generated/updated files back to the `main` branch with a
   `[skip ci]` message.

</Steps>

The deployed documentation site is built using the contents of the repository
*after* these generated files are committed, ensuring the latest changelogs are
always published.
