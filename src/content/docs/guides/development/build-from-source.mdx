Tenzir uses [CMake](https://cmake.org) as build system with a C++23 compiler.

## Manual

### Compile

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir
cd tenzir
```

Ensure all [dependencies](#dependencies) are available, then configure and
build using a preset:

```sh
cmake --list-presets          # discover available presets
cmake --preset <preset-name>
cmake --build --preset <preset-name>
```

Two families of macOS presets exist:

| Preset family   | Toolchain                        | Use case                            |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `macos-clang-*` | Homebrew LLVM with custom libc++ | When you need latest Clang features |
| `macos-xcode-*` | Apple Clang (Xcode)              | Simpler setup, standard toolchain   |

For example, to build a release on macOS with Xcode:

```sh
cmake --preset macos-xcode-release
cmake --build --preset macos-xcode-release
```

Or with Homebrew LLVM:

```sh
cmake --preset macos-clang-release
cmake --build --preset macos-clang-release
```

For custom configurations without presets:

```sh
cmake -B build -G Ninja
cmake --build build
```

:::note
CMake defaults to a `Debug` build. When performance matters, use
`-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`.
:::

### Test

Run unit tests via CTest:

```sh
ctest --test-dir build
```

Run integration tests via [tenzir-test](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir-test):

```sh
cd test
uvx tenzir-test
```

### Install

Install Tenzir system-wide:

```sh
cmake --install build
```

Options:

- `--prefix /path/to/prefix` — custom install location
- `--strip` — remove debug symbols
- `--component Runtime` — install only runtime files, not development headers

### Clean

Delete the build tree to start fresh:

```sh
rm -rf build
```

This avoids configuration glitches when switching build types.

## Docker

The [Dockerfile](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/blob/main/Dockerfile) provides
multiple build targets.

Build the default image:

```sh
docker build -t tenzir/tenzir .
```

Build the node image (runs `tenzir-node` as entrypoint):

```sh
docker build -t tenzir/tenzir-node --target tenzir-node .
```

Build the development image with all build-time dependencies for creating custom
plugins:

```sh
docker build -t tenzir/tenzir-dev --target development .
```

## Nix

We use [Nix](https://nixos.org) for reproducible builds on Linux and macOS. The
flake provides all [dependencies](#dependencies):

```sh
nix develop
cmake --preset nix-clang-release
cmake --build --preset nix-clang-release
```

For pre-built dependencies, configure the Tenzir binary cache:

```sh
nix run nixpkgs#cachix -- use tenzir
```

You can also delegate the entire build to Nix with `nix build .#tenzir-de`, but
this doesn't support incremental builds.

To build static binaries on Linux:

```sh
nix develop .#tenzir-static.unchecked
cmake --preset nix-static-release
cmake --build --preset nix-static-release
```
