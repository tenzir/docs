title: Write tests
---

This guide shows you how to create integration tests with the
[`tenzir-test`](/reference/test-framework) framework. You'll set up a standalone
repository, write test scenarios, and record reference output to verify your
pipelines work as expected. If you already have tests and want to run them, see
the [run tests](/guides/testing/run-tests) guide.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or newer.
- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed locally.
- A working installation of Tenzir. The harness automatically detects `tenzir`
  and `tenzir-node` using this precedence:
  1. `TENZIR_BINARY` / `TENZIR_NODE_BINARY` environment variables
  2. Local binary on `PATH`
  3. Fallback to `uvx tenzir` / `uvx --from tenzir tenzir-node` when `uv` is installed

  Most users need no configuration because the harness uses `uvx` to fetch
  Tenzir on demand.

## Step 1: Scaffold a project

Create a clean directory that holds nothing but integration tests and their
shared assets. The harness treats this directory as the **project root**.

```sh
mkdir demo
cd demo
```

## Step 2: Check the harness

Run the harness through `uvx` to make sure the tooling works without setting up
a virtual environment. `uvx` downloads and caches the latest release when
needed.

```sh
uvx tenzir-test --help
```

If the command succeeds, you're ready to add tests.

## Step 3: Add shared data

Populate `inputs/` with artifacts that tests will read. The example below stores
a short NDJSON dataset that models a few alerts.

```json
{"id": 1, "severity": 5, "message": "Disk usage above 90%"}
{"id": 2, "severity": 2, "message": "Routine backup completed"}
{"id": 3, "severity": 7, "message": "Authentication failure on admin"}
```

Save the snippet as `inputs/alerts.ndjson`.

## Step 4: Author a pipeline test

Create your first scenario under `tests/`. The harness discovers tests
recursively, so you can organize them by feature or risk level. Here, you create
`tests/high-severity.tql`.

```tql title="tests/high-severity.tql"
from_file f"{env("TENZIR_INPUTS")}/alerts.ndjson"
where severity >= 5
project id, message
sort id
```

The harness also injects a unique scratch directory into `TENZIR_TMP_DIR` while
each test executes. Use it for transient files you do not want under version
control; pass `--keep` when you run `tenzir-test` if you need to inspect the
generated artifacts afterwards.

### Stream raw output while iterating

During early iterations you may want to inspect command output before you record
reference artifacts. Enable _passthrough mode_ via `--passthrough` (`-p`) to
pipe the `tenzir` process output directly to your terminal while the harness
still provisions fixtures and environment variables:

```sh
uvx tenzir-test --passthrough tests/high-severity.tql
```

The harness enforces the exit code but skips comparisons, letting you decide
when to capture the baseline with `--update`.

## Step 5: Capture the reference output

Run the harness once in update mode to execute the pipeline and write the
expected output next to the test.

```sh
uvx tenzir-test --update
```

The command produces `tests/high-severity.txt` with the captured stdout.

```json
{"id":1,"message":"Disk usage above 90%"}
{"id":3,"message":"Authentication failure on admin"}
```

Review the reference file, adjust the pipeline if needed, and rerun `--update`
until you are satisfied with the results. Commit the `.tql` test and `.txt`
baseline together so future runs can compare against known-good output. At this
point you can [run the test suite](/guides/testing/run-tests) without
`--update` to verify that the actual output matches the baseline.

## Step 6: Provide stdin input

Some tests need data piped to stdin rather than read from files. Place a
`.stdin` file next to the test to provide this content automatically. This
simplifies TQL tests by letting pipelines start with a parser directly.

### TQL pipelines with stdin

Create `tests/parsing/csv.stdin` with your test data:

```csv title="tests/parsing/csv.stdin"
name,count
alice,42
bob,23
```

Create `tests/parsing/csv.tql` that reads from stdin:

```tql title="tests/parsing/csv.tql"
read_csv
sort name
```

Run the test with `--update` to capture the baseline:

```sh
uvx tenzir-test --update tests/parsing/csv.tql
```

The harness pipes the CSV data to tenzir's stdin, so `read_csv` processes it
directly. This is an alternative to using `.input` files with
`from_file env("TENZIR_INPUT")`—choose whichever fits your test better.

### Shell scripts with stdin

The same mechanism works for shell scripts. Create `tests/shell/echo.sh`:

```sh title="tests/shell/echo.sh"
#!/bin/sh
cat
```

Create `tests/shell/echo.stdin` with the input data:

```text title="tests/shell/echo.stdin"
Hello from stdin!
```

The harness pipes the contents of `echo.stdin` to the script's stdin.

### Combine stdin with input files

Tests can use both `.stdin` and `.input` files together. The stdin content gets
piped to the process, while the input file path is available via `TENZIR_INPUT`.

Create `tests/shell/process.sh`:

```sh title="tests/shell/process.sh"
#!/bin/sh
echo "from stdin:"
cat
echo "from TENZIR_INPUT:"
cat "$TENZIR_INPUT"
```

Create the corresponding files:

```text title="tests/shell/process.stdin"
stdin content
```

```text title="tests/shell/process.input"
input file content
```

Run `--update` to capture both sources in the baseline output. The output looks
like this:

```text title="tests/shell/process.txt"
from stdin:
stdin content
from TENZIR_INPUT:
input file content
```

## Step 7: Introduce a fixture

Fixtures let you bootstrap external resources and expose their configuration
through environment variables. Add a simple `node`-driven test to exercise a
running Tenzir node.

Create `tests/node/ping.tql` with the following contents:

```tql
---
fixtures: [node]
timeout: 10
---

// Get the version from the running node.
remote {
  version
}
```

Because the test needs a node to run, include the built-in `node` fixture and
give it a reasonable timeout. The fixture starts `tenzir-node`, injects connection
details into the environment, and tears the process down after the run. Capture
the baseline via `--update` just like before.

The fixture launches `tenzir-node` from the directory that owns the test file, so
`tenzir-node.yaml` placed next to the scenario can refer to files with relative
paths (for example `../inputs/alerts.ndjson`).

### Reuse fixtures with suites

When several tests should share the same fixture lifecycle, promote their
directory to a **suite**. Add `suite:` to the directory’s `test.yaml` and keep
the fixture selection alongside the other defaults:

```yaml
# tests/http/test.yaml
suite: smoke-http
fixtures: [http]
timeout: 45
retry: 2
```

Key behaviour:

- Suites are directory-scoped. Once a `test.yaml` declares `suite`, every test
  in that directory _and its subdirectories_ joins automatically. Move the
  scenarios that should remain independent into a sibling directory.
- Suites run sequentially on a single worker. The harness activates the shared
  fixtures once, executes members in lexicographic order of their relative
  paths, and tears the fixtures down afterwards. Other suites (and standalone
  tests) still run in parallel when `--jobs` allows it.
- Per-test frontmatter cannot introduce `suite`, and suite members may not
  define their own `fixtures` or `retry`. Keep those policies in the directory
  defaults so every member agrees on the shared lifecycle. Outside a suite,
  frontmatter can still set `fixtures`, `retry`, or `timeout` as before.
- Tests can override other keys (for example `inputs:` or additional metadata)
  on a per-file basis when necessary.

Run the `http` directory that defines the suite when you iterate on it:

```sh
uvx tenzir-test tests/http
```

Selecting a single file inside that suite fails fast with a descriptive error,
which keeps the fixture lifecycle predictable and prevents partial runs from
leaving shared state behind.

### Drive fixtures manually

When you switch to the Python runner you can drive fixtures manually. The
controller API makes it easy to start, stop, or even crash the same `node`
fixture inside a single test:

```python
# runner: python
# fixtures: [node]

import signal

# Context-manager style: `with` automatically calls `start()` and `stop()` on
# the fixture.
with acquire_fixture("node") as node:
    tenzir = Executor.from_env(node.env)
    tenzir.run("remove { version }")  # talk to the running node

# Without the context manager, you need to call `start()` and `stop()` manually.
node.start()
Executor.from_env(node.env).run("version")
node.stop()
```

This imperative style complements the declarative `fixtures: [node]` flow and
is especially useful for fault-injection scenarios. The harness preloads
helpers like `acquire_fixture`, `Executor`, and `fixtures()`, so Python-mode
tests can call them directly.

When you restart the same controller, the node keeps using the state and cache
directories it created during the first `start()`. Those paths (exported via
`TENZIR_NODE_STATE_DIRECTORY` and `TENZIR_NODE_CACHE_DIRECTORY`) live inside the
test’s scratch directory by default and are cleaned up automatically when the
controller goes out of scope. Acquire a fresh controller when you need a brand
new workspace.

## Step 8: Organize defaults with `test.yaml`

As suites grow, you can extract shared configuration into directory-level
defaults. Place a `tests/node/test.yaml` file with convenient settings:

```yaml
fixtures: [node]
timeout: 120
# Optional: reuse datasets that live in tests/data/ instead of the project root.
inputs: ../data
```

The harness merges this mapping into every test under `tests/node/`. Relative
paths resolve against the directory that owns the YAML file, so `inputs: ../data`
points at `tests/data/`. Individual files still override keys in their
frontmatter when necessary.

## Next steps

You now have a project that owns its inputs, tests, fixtures, and baselines.
From here you can:

- [Run tests](/guides/testing/run-tests) to learn about executing the suite,
  selecting tests, and setting up CI.
- Add custom runners under `runners/` when you need specialized logic around
  `tenzir` invocations.
- Build Python fixtures that publish or verify data through the helper APIs in
  `tenzir_test.fixtures`.
- Explore coverage collection by passing `--coverage` to the harness.

whenever you need deeper details about runners, fixtures, or configuration
knobs.
