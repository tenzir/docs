title: Run tests
---

This guide shows you how to run existing integration tests with the
[`tenzir-test`](/reference/test-framework) framework. You'll learn how to
execute the test suite, control output verbosity, select specific tests, handle
flaky scenarios, and run multi-project setups.

When you're ready to create your own tests, see the
[write tests](/guides/testing/write-tests) guide.

## Run the test suite

Execute all tests from the project root:

```sh
uvx tenzir-test
```

The harness discovers tests under `tests/`, runs them against their baselines,
and returns a non-zero exit code when any output diverges. By default (quiet
mode) the harness only shows failures, which keeps large test runs readable.

## Control output

Add `--verbose` (`-v`) to see passing and skipped tests as they complete:

```sh
uvx tenzir-test --verbose
```

Use `--debug` to see comparison targets alongside the usual harness diagnostics.
Debug mode automatically enables verbose output so you see all test results. For
CI-only visibility you can set `TENZIR_TEST_DEBUG=1`.

Add `--summary` together with `--verbose` when you also want the tabular
breakdown and failure tree at the end:

```sh
uvx tenzir-test --verbose --summary
```

Use `--passthrough` (`-p`) to stream raw stdout/stderr to the terminal instead
of comparing against baselines. This is useful during early iterations when you
want to inspect command output before recording reference artifacts:

```sh
uvx tenzir-test --passthrough tests/high-severity.tql
```

## Select tests

### By path

Pass individual files or directories as positional arguments:

```sh
uvx tenzir-test tests/alerts/high-severity.tql
```

You can list multiple paths in a single invocation:

```sh
uvx tenzir-test tests/alerts tests/parsing/csv.tql
```

### By name pattern

Use `-m`/`--match` to select tests whose relative path contains a given
substring:

```sh
uvx tenzir-test -m context
```

Bare strings without glob metacharacters perform a **substring match** against
the test's relative POSIX path from the project root. For example, `-m mysql`
matches any test whose path contains `mysql`, such as
`tests/mysql/connect.tql`. This means you no longer need to wrap the keyword in
wildcards---`-m mysql` works the same as `-m '*mysql*'`.

Patterns containing `*`, `?`, or `[` still use
[fnmatch](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html) glob syntax with
case-sensitive comparison, so existing glob patterns continue to work:

```sh
uvx tenzir-test -m 'tests/*/connect.tql'
```

Multiple patterns act as an OR filter---a test runs if it matches any pattern:

```sh
uvx tenzir-test -m create -m update
```

You can combine `-m` with positional paths. The harness intersects both
selections, so only tests matching both the path selection and a pattern are
run. This lets you narrow a directory to a subset of its tests:

```sh
uvx tenzir-test tests/context/ -m create
```

:::note[Suite expansion]
If a matched test belongs to a suite (configured via `test.yaml`), all tests
in that suite are included automatically. Empty and whitespace-only patterns
are silently ignored.

## Retry flaky tests

If a scenario fails intermittently, add a `retry` entry to its frontmatter so
the harness reruns it before flagging a failure. The value is the **total**
attempt budget:

```yaml
---
retry: 3
---
```

With `retry: 3`, the test runs up to three times. Intermediate attempts stay
quiet; the final result line includes `attempts=3/3` (or the actual number on a
success). Use this as a guardrail while you investigate the underlying flake and
keep the budget small to avoid masking issues.

## Run multiple projects

Large organisations often split tests across several repositories but still want
an aggregated run. List additional project directories after `--root` and add
`--all-projects` to execute the root alongside its satellites under a single
invocation:

```sh
uvx tenzir-test --root example-project --all-projects ../example-satellite
```

The root project (`example-project` above) supplies the shared fixtures and
runners. Satellites inherit those definitions, can register their own helpers,
and run their tests in isolation. Because the selection only listed the
satellite, `--all-projects` keeps the root in scope. The CLI prints a compact
summary showing how many tests each project contributes and which runners are
involved. Add `--verbose` to see individual test results as they complete, and
combine it with `--summary` for the tabular breakdown and detailed failure
listing after each project.

## Load packages

When your tests need packages, point `--package-dirs` at the package directories
(or a parent that contains them). The flag is repeatable and supports
comma-separated lists:

```sh
uvx tenzir-test --package-dirs example-library example-library
```

Here `example-library` contains multiple packages, so the harness loads them all
and makes sibling packages visible for cross-imports. You can also declare
package directories in a directory `test.yaml` via `package-dirs:`; those entries
merge with `--package-dirs`.

## Automate runs

Once the suite passes locally, integrate it into your CI pipeline. Configure the
job to install Python 3.12, install `tenzir-test`, provision or download the
required Tenzir binaries, and execute `uvx tenzir-test --root .`. For
reproducible results, keep your datasets small and deterministic, and prefer
fixtures that wipe state between runs.
