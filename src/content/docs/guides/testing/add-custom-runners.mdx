title: Add custom runners
---

Runners tell `tenzir-test` how to execute a discovered file. This guide shows
you how to register the XXD runner from the example project so you can compare
binary artifacts by dumping their hexadecimal representation with `xxd`.

## Prerequisites

- Complete the setup in [write tests](/guides/testing/write-tests) so you have a
  project root with `runners/` and at least one passing test.
- Install the [`xxd`](https://man.archlinux.org/man/xxd.1.en) utility. It ships
  with most platforms.

## Step 1: Prepare the runners package

Create `runners/__init__.py` if it does not exist yet. The harness imports this
module automatically on start-up.

```sh
touch runners/__init__.py
```

## Step 2: Implement the XXD runner

Copy the runner from the example project and keep it under version control so
teammates can use the same convention. The latest reference implementation lives
in
[example-project/runners/xxd.py](https://github.com/tenzir/test/blob/main/example-project/runners/xxd.py).

If you prefer to start from a scaffold, drop the following template into
`runners/xxd.py` and fill in the `TODO` notes where your implementation needs
to differ (for example when you call a different tool or emit additional
artifacts).

```python
# runners/xxd.py
from __future__ import annotations

from pathlib import Path

from tenzir_test import runners
from tenzir_test.runners._utils import get_run_module


class XxdRunner(runners.ExtRunner):
    """Hexdump runner that turns *.xxd files into reference artifacts."""

    def __init__(self) -> None:
        super().__init__(name="xxd", ext="xxd")

    def run(self, test: Path, update: bool, coverage: bool = False) -> bool:
        del coverage  # this runner does not integrate with LLVM coverage

        run_mod = get_run_module()
        passthrough = run_mod.is_passthrough_enabled()

        # 1. Prepare the command. Adjust flags or the executable for your tool.
        cmd = ["xxd", "-g1", str(test)]
        # TODO: Replace "xxd" or tweak arguments when you wrap a different command.

        try:
            completed = run_mod.run_subprocess(
                cmd,
                capture_output=not passthrough,
            )
        except FileNotFoundError:
            run_mod.report_failure(test, "└─▶ xxd is not available on PATH")
            return False

        if completed.returncode != 0:
            # 2. Surface a readable error message and bail out early.
            run_mod.report_failure(test, f"└─▶ xxd exited with {completed.returncode}")
            return False

        if passthrough:
            # 3. Passthrough runs stop after executing the command.
            run_mod.success(test)
            return True

        output = completed.stdout or b""

        # 4. Update reference artifacts when requested.
        ref_path = test.with_suffix(".txt")
        if update:
            ref_path.write_bytes(output)
            run_mod.success(test)
            return True

        if not ref_path.exists():
            run_mod.report_failure(test, f"└─▶ Missing reference file {ref_path}")
            return False

        # 5. Compare against the baseline and print a diff on mismatch.
        expected = ref_path.read_bytes()
        if expected != output:
            run_mod.report_failure(test, "")
            run_mod.print_diff(expected, output, ref_path)
            return False

        run_mod.success(test)
        return True


runners.register(XxdRunner())
```

Finally, expose the runner from `runners/__init__.py` so the harness picks it
up on start-up:

```python
# runners/__init__.py
"""Project runners."""

# Import bundled runners so they register on package import.
from . import xxd  # noqa: F401

__all__ = ["xxd"]
```

## Step 3: Add a hexdump test

Create a directory for the new tests and add a sample input string.

```sh
mkdir -p tests/hex
cat <<EOD > tests/hex/hello.xxd
Hello Tenzir!
EOD
```

## Step 4: Capture the reference output

Run the harness in update mode so it generates the expected hexdump next to the
`.xxd` file.

```sh
uvx tenzir-test --update
```

The command produces `tests/hex/hello.txt` similar to the following snippet:

```text
00000000: 48 65 6c 6c 6f 20 54 65 6e 7a 69 72 21 0a        Hello Tenzir!.
```

Subsequent runs without `--update` rerun `xxd` and compare the fresh dump with
the stored baseline.

Pass `--verbose` when you want to see which artifacts the runner compares. Use
`--debug` when you also need the framework diagnostics; it includes the verbose
stream automatically.

## Step 5: Reuse the runner across projects

Keep the runner in your template repository or internal tooling so other
projects can copy it verbatim. Use `runners.register_alias("xxd-hexdump", "xxd")`
when you prefer a more descriptive name in frontmatter.

When you invoke the harness with multiple projects in the same command, pass
`--all-projects` so the root project executes alongside the satellites. The
positional paths you list after the flags form the **selection**; in this case
it usually only names satellite roots. `--all-projects` opts the root back in,
its runners load first, and satellites reuse them automatically. That makes it
simple to keep shared runners (like `xxd`) in a central project while satellite
suites focus on their own tests.

## Next steps

- Pair the runner with fixtures that download or generate binary artifacts
  before each test.
- Combine custom runners with suites by setting `suite:` in a directory-level
  `test.yaml` when several runner-backed tests should share the same fixture
  lifecycle.
- Use directory-level `test.yaml` files or per-test frontmatter to set
  `inputs:` when the runner should read data from a different directory than the
  project default.
- Extend the runner to emit `*.diff` artifacts when the hexdumps diverge.
- Branch on `run.get_harness_mode()` or `run.is_passthrough_enabled()` when you
  need bespoke behaviour for passthrough runs, but prefer to rely on
  `run.run_subprocess()` for most cases so output handling stays consistent.
- Review the [test framework reference](/reference/test-framework/) to explore
  additional runner hooks and helpers.
