title: Create fixtures
---

This guide shows you how to create a fixture, wire it into the test harness, and
use it from a test. You will build an HTTP echo server as a running example and
then learn how to share fixtures across suites, handle missing dependencies,
manage containers, add structured options, and validate test behavior with
fixture assertions.

## Prerequisites

- Follow [write tests](/guides/testing/write-tests) to scaffold a project and
  install `tenzir-test`.
- Make sure your project root already contains `fixtures/`, `inputs/`, and
  `tests/` directories (they can be empty).

## Register the fixture

`tenzir-test` imports `fixtures/__init__.py` automatically. Each module you
import there registers its `@fixture()`-decorated functions on startup:

```python
# fixtures/__init__.py
from . import http  # noqa: F401  (side effect: register fixture)
```

## Implement a fixture

A fixture is a generator decorated with `@fixture()`. It sets up a resource,
yields a dictionary of environment variables that tests can read, and cleans up
in a `finally` block. Here is a minimal HTTP echo server:

```python
# fixtures/http.py
from tenzir_test import fixture

@fixture()
def http():
    server = start_echo_server()          # your setup logic
    try:
        yield {"HTTP_FIXTURE_URL": server.url}  # expose to tests
    finally:
        server.shutdown()                 # always clean up
```

The harness calls the generator once per fixture activation. Everything before
`yield` is setup, the dictionary becomes environment variables, and the
`finally` block runs regardless of whether the test passes or fails. Fixtures
also receive a per-test scratch directory via `TENZIR_TMP_DIR` for temporary
files.

## Use the fixture in a test

Request a fixture by name in the test's frontmatter. The harness starts it
before the test runs and exports its environment variables:

```tql
---
fixtures: [http]
---

from {x: 42, y: "foo"}
http env("HTTP_FIXTURE_URL"), body=this
```

## Capture the baseline

Run the harness in update mode to record the expected output:

```sh
uvx tenzir-test --update
```

This creates `tests/http/echo-read.txt` with the fixture's response. Subsequent
runs compare live output against this baseline. Add `--debug` to see fixture
lifecycle logs, or set `TENZIR_TEST_DEBUG=1` in CI.

## Share a fixture across a suite

By default each test gets its own fixture lifecycle. To start a fixture once and
share it across multiple tests, declare a suite in a directory-level
`test.yaml`:

```yaml
# tests/http/test.yaml
suite: smoke-http
fixtures: [http]
timeout: 45
```

Every test file in that directory joins the suite. The harness starts the
fixture once, runs all members in lexicographic order, and tears it down
afterwards. Suites pin to a single worker but different suites still run in
parallel when `--jobs` permits.

Tests inside a suite inherit `fixtures`, `timeout`, and `retry` from the suite
configuration and cannot override them in frontmatter. Other keys like `inputs:`
remain overridable per file.

Run just the suite directory to focus on it:

```sh
uvx tenzir-test tests/http
```

Selecting a single file inside a suite fails fast with a descriptive error to
keep the lifecycle predictable.

## Handle unavailable fixtures

Fixtures that depend on external tools (a container runtime, a cloud CLI) should
raise `FixtureUnavailable` when the dependency is missing:

```python
from tenzir_test.fixtures import FixtureUnavailable, fixture

@fixture()
def mysql():
    if not shutil.which("docker"):
        raise FixtureUnavailable("docker not found")
    # ...
```

By default this causes a test failure. To convert it into a skip, add a
structured `skip` entry to the suite's `test.yaml`:

```yaml
suite: mysql-integration
fixtures: [mysql]
skip:
  on: fixture-unavailable
```

The harness marks every test in the suite as skipped and includes the exception
message in the output. This opt-in design keeps suites failing loudly by
default — you only suppress the failure for environments where the missing
dependency is expected.

## Use container runtime helpers

When a fixture manages a single container directly rather than orchestrating
services through Docker Compose, the `container_runtime` module
(`tenzir_test.fixtures.container_runtime`) handles the repetitive parts:
finding a runtime, running containers, polling for readiness, and tearing down.

A container-backed fixture follows four steps:

1. **Detect the runtime.** `detect_runtime()` probes the system for Podman
   first, then Docker, and returns a `RuntimeSpec`. When no runtime is found it
   returns `None` — raise `FixtureUnavailable` so the suite can
   [skip gracefully](#handle-unavailable-fixtures).

2. **Start the container.** `start_detached(runtime, args)` runs
   `<runtime> run -d` and returns a `ManagedContainer` handle. Pass the same
   flags you would use on the command line (port mappings, environment
   variables, image name).

3. **Wait for readiness.** `wait_until_ready(probe, ...)` calls your probe
   function repeatedly until it returns `(True, observation)`. On timeout it
   raises `ContainerReadinessTimeout` with the context string and the last
   observation, so you can tell _why_ the service did not come up.

4. **Clean up.** Call `container.stop()` in a `finally` block. The
   `ManagedContainer` handle also exposes `exec()`, `inspect_json()`,
   `is_running()`, and `copy_from()` for anything you need during the test.

The `example-project/fixtures/container.py` in this repository shows the
pattern applied end-to-end.

## Add structured options

When a fixture needs runtime configuration — a custom port, a TLS toggle, a
database name — declare a frozen dataclass and pass it to `@fixture()`:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from tenzir_test import current_options, fixture

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class HttpOptions:
    port: int = 0

@fixture(options=HttpOptions)
def http():
    opts = current_options("http")
    server = start_echo_server(port=opts.port)
    # ...
```

Every field needs a default so that bare requests (`fixtures: [http]`) keep
working. Test authors provide values via a mapping in `test.yaml` or
frontmatter:

```yaml
fixtures:
  - http:
      port: 9090
```

The harness constructs the dataclass from the YAML mapping. Nested dataclasses
work too — the harness walks the type annotations recursively. See the
[test framework reference](/reference/test-framework/#fixture-options) for the
full options API.

## Add fixture assertions

The harness supports [assertions](/reference/test-framework#assertions) that run
after a test succeeds but before teardown. Fixture assertions are one category:
they let a fixture validate what happened during the test by declaring an
assertions dataclass and an `assert_test` hook.

### Declare the assertions dataclass

Define a frozen dataclass describing the expected shape. Nested dataclasses work
the same way as options:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class ExpectedRequest:
    count: int = 1
    method: str = "POST"
    path: str = "/"
    body: str = ""

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class HttpAssertions:
    expected_request: ExpectedRequest | None = None
```

### Register assertions with the fixture

Pass the dataclass to `@fixture(assertions=...)` and return a `FixtureHandle`
with an `assert_test` hook:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Any

from tenzir_test import FixtureHandle, current_options, fixture


@fixture(options=HttpOptions, assertions=HttpAssertions)
def http() -> FixtureHandle:
    opts = current_options("http")
    server = start_echo_server(port=opts.port)

    def _assert_test(*, test: Path, assertions: HttpAssertions, **_: Any) -> None:
        if assertions.expected_request is None:
            return
        observed = server.get_request_log()
        expected = assertions.expected_request
        if len(observed) != expected.count:
            raise AssertionError(
                f"expected {expected.count} request(s), got {len(observed)}"
            )
        # ... validate method, path, body ...

    return FixtureHandle(
        env={"HTTP_FIXTURE_URL": server.url},
        teardown=server.shutdown,
        hooks={"assert_test": _assert_test},
    )
```

The `assert_test` callback receives keyword arguments `test` (the test path),
`assertions` (the typed dataclass instance), and `fixture` (the fixture name).
When the callback raises an exception, the harness reports the test as failed.

### Write assertion payloads in test frontmatter

Test authors declare assertion payloads under `assertions.fixtures.<name>`:

```yaml
---
fixtures: [http]
assertions:
  fixtures:
    http:
      expected_request:
        count: 1
        method: POST
        path: /status/not-found
        body: '{"foo":"bar"}'
---
```

Omitting the `assertions` block skips the hook entirely. You can also retrieve
the typed assertions instance inside a fixture with
`current_assertions("http")`.

See the
[test framework reference](/reference/test-framework/#fixture-assertions) for
the full assertions API.

## Control fixtures from Python tests

The declarative workflow (`fixtures: [http]`) covers most cases. When a
Python-mode test needs to start, stop, or restart a fixture explicitly — for
example to simulate a crash — use `acquire_fixture()`:

```python
# runner: python
with acquire_fixture("http") as http:
    env = http.env
    # exercise the system while the fixture runs

# start a fresh instance
http = acquire_fixture("http")
http.start()
http.stop()
```

The controller wraps the registered fixture factory. `start()` enters the
generator and stores the environment mapping on `controller.env`; `stop()`
triggers the `finally` block. Use the context manager form when a single
lifecycle suffices, or call `start()`/`stop()` manually when you need multiple
cycles.

### Fixture hooks

Fixtures can advertise extra operations by returning a `FixtureHandle` with
named hooks:

```python
@fixture()
def node():
    process = _start_node()
    return FixtureHandle(
        env=_make_env(process),
        teardown=lambda: process.terminate(),
        hooks={"kill": lambda sig=SIGTERM: process.send_signal(sig)},
    )
```

Test authors access hooks as attributes on the controller. Assert their presence
so tests fail immediately when the contract changes:

```python
node = acquire_fixture("node")
node.start()
assert hasattr(node, "kill")
node.kill(signal.SIGKILL)
node.stop()
```

## Stabilise flaky scenarios

Fixture-backed tests may occasionally need retries when a service takes longer
to initialise. Add `retry` to the frontmatter:

```yaml
---
fixtures: [http]
retry: 4
---
```

The number is the total attempt budget. Treat this as a temporary safety net and
investigate persistent flakes — long retry chains mask race conditions.
