title: Enrich with network inventory

Tenzir's [enrichment framework](/explanations/enrichment) features
_lookup tables_ that you can use to enrich data in your pipelines. Lookup tables
have a unique property that makes them attractive for tracking information
associated with CIDR subnets: when you use `subnet` values as keys, you can
probe the lookup table with `ip` values and will get a longest-prefix match.

To illustrate, consider this lookup table:

| Subnet      | Mapping  |
| ----------- | -------- |
| 10.0.0.0/22 | Machines |
| 10.0.0.0/24 | Servers  |
| 10.0.1.0/24 | Clients  |

When you have subnets as keys as above, you can query them with an IP address
during enrichment. Say you want to enrich IP address `10.0.0.1`. Since the
longest (bitwise) prefix match is `10.0.0.0/24`, you will get `Servers` as a
result. The same goes for IP address `10.0.0.255`, but `10.0.1.1` will yield
`Clients`. The IP address `10.0.2.1` yields Machines, since it is neither in
`10.0.0.0/24` nor `10.0.1.0/24`, but `10.0.0.0/21`. The IP adress `10.0.4.1`
won't match at all, because it's not any of the three subnets.

## Populate subnet mappings from a CSV file

It's common to have Excel sheets or exported CSV files of inventory data. Let's
consider this example:

```csv title=inventory.csv
subnet,owner,function
10.0.0.0/22,John,machines
10.0.0.0/24,Derek,servers
10.0.1.0/24,Peter,clients
```

First, create the context:

```tql
context::create_lookup_table "subnets"
```

Then populate it:

```tql
from_file "inventory.csv" {
  read_csv
}
context::update "subnets", key=subnet
```

## Enrich IP addresses with the subnet table

Now that we have a lookup table with subnet keys, we can enrich any data
containing IP addresses with it. For example, let's consider this simplified
Suricata flow record:

```json title=sample.json
{
  "timestamp": "2021-11-17T13:32:43.237882",
  "src_ip": "10.0.0.1",
  "src_port": 54402,
  "dest_ip": "10.1.1.254",
  "dest_port": 53,
  "proto": "UDP",
  "event_type": "flow",
  "app_proto": "dns"
}
```

Let's use the `enrich` operator to add the subnet context to the two IP address
fields:

```tql
load_file "/tmp/sample.json"
read_json
context::enrich "subnets", key=src_ip, into=src_ip_context
context::enrich "subnets", key=dest_ip, into=dest_ip_context
```

```tql
{
  timestamp: 2021-11-17T13:32:43.237882,
  src_ip: 10.0.0.1,
  src_port: 54402,
  dest_ip: 10.1.1.254,
  dest_port: 53,
  proto: "UDP",
  event_type: "flow",
  app_proto: "dns",
  src_ip_context: {
    subnet: 10.0.0.0/24,
    owner: "Derek",
    function: "servers",
  },
  dest_ip_context: null
}
```

We have enriched all IP addresses in the flow event with the `subnets` context.
Now go hunt down Derek!
