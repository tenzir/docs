title: Read and watch files
---

This guide covers how to read files and monitor directories for new files using
the [`from_file`](/reference/operators/from_file) operator. Whether you process
individual files, batch process directories, or set up real-time file
monitoring, [`from_file`](/reference/operators/from_file) provides a unified
approach to file-based data ingestion.

## Basic File Reading

The [`from_file`](/reference/operators/from_file) operator handles various file
types and formats. Start with these fundamental patterns for reading individual
files.

### Single Files

To read a single file, specify the path to the
[`from_file`](/reference/operators/from_file) operator:

```tql
from_file "/path/to/file.json"
```

The operator automatically detects the file format from the file extension.
This works for all supported formats including JSON, CSV, Parquet, and others.

### Compressed Files

The operator handles compressed files automatically. You need no additional
configuration:

```tql
from_file "/path/to/file.csv.gz"
```

Supported compression formats include gzip, bzip2, and Zstd.

### Custom Parsing

When automatic format detection doesn't suffice, specify a custom
[parsing](/reference/operators/#parsing) pipeline:

```tql
from_file "/path/to/file.log" {
  read_syslog
}
```

The parsing pipeline runs on the file content and must return events.

## Directory Processing

You can process multiple files efficiently using glob patterns. This section
covers batch processing and recursive directory operations.

### Processing Multiple Files

Use glob patterns to process multiple files at once:

```tql
from_file "/path/to/directory/*.csv.zst"
```

This example processes all Zstd-compressed CSV files in the specified
directory.

You can also use glob patterns to consume files regardless of their format:

```tql
from_file "~/data/**"
```

This processes all files in the `~/data` directory and its subdirectories,
automatically detecting and parsing each file format.

### Recursive Directory Processing

Use `**` to match files recursively through subdirectories:

```tql
from_file "/path/to/directory/**.csv"
```

### Custom Parsing for Multiple Files

When you process multiple files with custom parsing, the pipeline runs
separately for each file:

```tql
from_file "/path/to/directory/*.log" {
  read_lines
}
```

## File Monitoring

Set up real-time file processing by monitoring directories for changes. These
features enable continuous data ingestion workflows.

### Watch for New Files

Use the `watch` parameter to monitor a directory for new files:

```tql
from_file "/path/to/directory/*.csv", watch=true
```

This sets up continuous monitoring, processing new files as they appear in the
directory.

### Remove Files After Processing

Combine watching with automatic file removal using the `remove` parameter:

```tql
from_file "/path/to/directory/*.csv", watch=true, remove=true
```

This approach helps you implement file-based queues where the system should
automatically clean up processed files.

## Cloud Storage Integration

Access files directly from cloud storage providers using their native URLs.
The operator supports major cloud platforms transparently.

### Amazon S3

Access S3 buckets directly using `s3://` URLs:

```tql
from_file "s3://bucket/path/to/file.csv"
```

Glob patterns work with S3 as well:

```tql
from_file "s3://bucket/data/**/*.parquet"
```

### Google Cloud Storage

Access GCS buckets using `gs://` URLs:

```tql
from_file "gs://bucket/path/to/file.csv"
```

Cloud storage integration uses Apache Arrow's filesystem APIs and supports the
same glob patterns and options as local files, including recursive globbing
across cloud storage hierarchies.

## Common Patterns

These examples demonstrate typical use cases that combine multiple features of
the [`from_file`](/reference/operators/from_file) operator for real-world scenarios.

### Real-time Log Processing

Monitor a log directory and process files as they arrive:

```tql
from_file "/var/log/application/*.log", watch=true {
  read_lines
  parse_json
}
```

### Batch Data Processing

Process all files in a data directory:

```tql
from_file "/data/exports/**.parquet"
```

### Archive Processing with Cleanup

Process archived data and remove files after successful ingestion:

```tql
from_file "/archive/*.csv.gz", remove=true
```

## Migration Notes

:::info[Transitioning from Legacy Operators]
We designed the [`from_file`](/reference/operators/from_file) operator to
replace the existing [`load_file`](/reference/operators/load_file),
[`load_s3`](/reference/operators/load_s3), and
[`load_gcs`](/reference/operators/load_gcs) operators. While we still support
these legacy operators, [`from_file`](/reference/operators/from_file) provides a
more unified and feature-rich approach to file ingestion.

We plan to add some advanced features from the legacy operators (such as file
tailing, anonymous S3 access, and Unix domain socket support) in future
releases of [`from_file`](/reference/operators/from_file).
