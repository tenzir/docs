title: Fetch data from APIs
---

This guide covers how to fetch data from HTTP APIs using the `http` operator.
Whether you make simple GET requests, handle authentication, or implement
pagination, the `http` operator provides flexible HTTP client capabilities for
API integration.

## Basic API Requests

Start with these fundamental patterns for making HTTP requests to APIs.

### Simple GET Requests

To fetch data from an API endpoint, pass the URL as the first parameter to the
`http` operator:

```tql
from {}
http "https://api.example.com/data"
```

The operator makes a GET request by default and forwards the response as an
event. Since `http` is a transformation, you can also specify the URL as a field
by referencing an event field that contains the URL:

```tql
from {url: "https://api.example.com/data"}
http url
```

This pattern is useful when processing multiple URLs or when URLs are generated dynamically.

### Parsing JSON Responses

Most APIs return JSON data. Parse JSON responses by providing a parsing
pipeline with the `read_json` operator:

```tql
from {url: "https://api.example.com/users"}
http url {
  read_json
}
```

This parses the JSON response into structured events that you can process
further.

### POST Requests with Data

Send data to APIs by specifying the `method` parameter as "post" and providing
the request body in the `payload` parameter:

```tql
from {
  url: "https://api.example.com/users",
  method: "post",
  payload: '{"name": "John", "email": "john@example.com"}'
}
http url,
  method=method,
  payload=payload
```

You can also parameterize the entire HTTP request using event fields by
referencing field values for each parameter:

```tql
from {
  url: "https://api.example.com/users",
  method: "post",
  data: {
    name: "John",
    email: "john@example.com"
  }
}
http url, method=method, payload=data
```

The operator automatically uses POST method when you specify a payload.

## Request Configuration

Configure requests with headers, authentication, and other options for
different API requirements.

### Adding Headers

Include custom headers by providing the `headers` parameter as a record
containing key-value pairs:

```tql
from {
  url: "https://api.example.com/data",
  headers: {
    "Authorization": "Bearer your-token-here",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  }
}
http url, headers=headers
```

Headers help you authenticate with APIs and specify request formats.

### TLS and Security

Enable TLS by setting the `tls` parameter to `true` and configure client
certificates using the `certfile` and `keyfile` parameters:

```tql
from {
  url: "https://secure-api.example.com/data",
  tls: true,
  certfile: "/path/to/client.crt",
  keyfile: "/path/to/client.key"
}
http url, tls=tls, certfile=certfile, keyfile=keyfile
```

Use these options when APIs require client certificate authentication.

### Timeout and Retry Configuration

Configure timeouts and retry behavior by setting the `connection_timeout`,
`max_retry_count`, and `retry_delay` parameters:

```tql
from {
  url: "https://api.example.com/data",
  timeout: 10s,
  max_retries: 3,
  retry_delay: 2s
}
http url,
  connection_timeout=timeout,
  max_retry_count=max_retries,
  retry_delay=retry_delay
```

These settings help handle network issues and API rate limiting gracefully.

## Data Enrichment

Use HTTP requests to enrich existing data with information from external APIs.

### Preserving Input Context

Keep original event data while adding API responses by specifying the
`response_field` parameter to control where the response is stored:

```tql
from {
  domain: "example.com",
  severity: "HIGH",
  api_url: "https://threat-intel.example.com/lookup",
  response_field: "threat_data"
}
http api_url + "?domain=" + domain, response_field=response_field
```

This approach preserves your original data and adds API responses in a specific
field.

### Adding Metadata

Capture HTTP response metadata by specifying the `metadata_field` parameter to
store status codes and headers separately from the response body:

```tql
from {
  url: "https://api.example.com/status",
  response_field: "data",
  metadata_field: "http_meta"
}
http url, response_field=response_field, metadata_field=metadata_field
```

The metadata includes status codes and response headers for debugging and
monitoring.

## Pagination and Bulk Processing

Handle APIs that return large datasets across multiple pages.

### Simple Pagination

Implement automatic pagination by providing an expression to the `paginate`
parameter that extracts the next page URL from the response:

```tql
from {
  url: "https://api.example.com/search?q=query"
}
http url,
  paginate="next_page_url" if has_more {
  read_json
}
```

The operator continues making requests as long as the pagination expression
returns a valid URL.

### Complex Pagination Logic

Handle APIs with custom pagination schemes by building pagination URLs
dynamically using expressions that reference response data:

```tql
let $base_url = "https://api.example.com/items"
from {
  url: $base_url + "?page=1",
  paginate_delay: 1s
}
http url,
  paginate=$base_url + "?page=" + (page + 1) if page < total_pages,
  paginate_delay=paginate_delay
```

This example builds pagination URLs dynamically based on response data.

### Rate Limiting

Control request frequency by configuring the `paginate_delay` parameter to add
delays between requests and the `parallel` parameter to limit concurrent
requests:

```tql
from {
  url: "https://api.example.com/data",
  paginate_delay: 500ms,
  parallel: 2
}
http url,
  paginate="next_url" if has_next,
  paginate_delay=paginate_delay,
  parallel=parallel
```

Use `paginate_delay` and `parallel` to manage request rates appropriately.

## Practical Examples

These examples demonstrate typical use cases for API integration in real-world
scenarios.

### API Monitoring

Monitor API health and response times:

```tql
from {
  url: "https://api.example.com/health",
  metadata_field: "response_meta"
}
http url, metadata_field=metadata_field {
  read_json
}
response_meta.response_time = now() - response_meta.timestamp
```

### Webhook Processing

Process incoming webhook data and make follow-up API calls:

```tql
from {
  webhook_id: "12345",
  user_id: "user123",
  api_base: "https://api.example.com/users/",
  response_field: "user_details"
}
http api_base + user_id, response_field=response_field {
  read_json
}
```

## Error Handling

Handle API errors and failures gracefully in your data pipelines.

### Retry Configuration

Configure automatic retries by setting the `max_retry_count` parameter to
specify the number of retry attempts and `retry_delay` to control the time
between retries:

```tql
from {
  url: "https://unreliable-api.example.com/data",
  max_retries: 5,
  retry_delay: 2s
}
http url,
  max_retry_count=max_retries,
  retry_delay=retry_delay {
  read_json
}
```

### Status Code Handling

Check HTTP status codes by capturing metadata and filtering based on the
`code` field to handle different response types:

```tql
from {
  url: "https://api.example.com/data",
  metadata_field: "meta"
}
http url, metadata_field=metadata_field {
  read_json
}
where meta.code >= 200 and meta.code < 300
```

## Best Practices

Follow these practices for reliable and efficient API integration:

1. **Use appropriate timeouts** - Set reasonable connection timeouts for your
   use case
2. **Implement retry logic** - Configure retries for handling transient
   failures
3. **Respect rate limits** - Use `parallel` and `paginate_delay` to control
   request rates
4. **Handle errors gracefully** - Check status codes and implement fallback
   logic
5. **Secure credentials** - Store API keys and tokens securely, not in code
6. **Monitor API usage** - Track response times and error rates for
   performance
