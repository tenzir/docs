title: Provision a node
---

Provisioning a node creates one in your workspace in the
[platform](/explanations/architecture/platform) and gives you a
configuration file with an authentication tokenâ€”ready to deploy.

Here's how to provision a self-hosted node:

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Steps>

1. Go to [app.tenzir.com/pipelines](https://app.tenzir.com/pipelines).
1. Click **Add node** in the left pane, and choose **Self-hosted node**.
1. Enter a name and click **Add node**.

</Steps>

The easiest way to continue is by spinning up a node with
[Docker](/guides/node-setup/deploy-a-node/docker).

:::tip[Ephemeral Nodes]
Instead of provisioning a node with a dedicated authentication token, you can
also [configure a workspace-wide
token](/guides/platform-management/use-ephemeral-nodes). Nodes that use this this
token are *ephemeral*, i.e., not explicitly managed by the platform and will
vanish once they disconnect.
