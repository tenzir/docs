This guide helps you determine the CPU, RAM, and storage resources needed for a
Tenzir node. Use the [calculator](#calculator) below to get concrete estimates
based on your deployment scenario.

## Calculator

Adjust the sliders to match your expected workload:

## Input factors

The calculator considers the following factors to estimate resource
requirements.

### Data volume

The amount of data flowing through your node is the primary driver for resource
requirements. You can specify your ingest rate either as **GB/day** or as
**events per second (EPS)**. The calculator converts between these units based
on the average bytes per event.

Typical event sizes vary by source:

- Firewall logs: 300–800 bytes
- EDR telemetry: 500–2,000 bytes
- Cloud audit logs: 1,000–5,000 bytes

### Sources

The number of distinct data sources feeding into your node. Each source requires
parsing incoming data (typically JSON) and maintaining input buffers. The
calculator assumes approximately 10 different log types per source, which is
typical for firewalls, EDRs, and cloud providers.

### Destinations

The number of outputs where your node sends data. Each destination requires
serializing data (e.g., to Parquet or JSON) and maintaining output buffers.
Common destinations include cloud storage, SIEMs, and data lakes.

### Edge storage

How long data stays in the node's edge storage before deletion or archival. This determines your **storage** requirements.
Tenzir uses Zstd compression, achieving roughly 10× reduction of the raw input
volume.

Note that this refers to data stored _on the node itself_, not data forwarded to
external destinations like a data lake.

## Workloads

Optional workloads add overhead to the base resource requirements.

### Normalization

Normalization parses and transforms raw data into structured events with a
common schema. This adds **CPU** overhead proportional to the number of sources
and log types.

### Enrichment

[Enriching](/explanations/enrichment) events with context data requires holding
lookup tables in memory. The **Context Size** slider lets you specify how much
data you plan to use for enrichment. This directly affects your **RAM**
requirements.

### Detection

Running detection rules, correlations, or analytics adds **CPU** overhead for
rule evaluation and **RAM** for maintaining state across events (e.g., for
time-windowed correlations).
