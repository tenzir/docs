title: Configure a node
---

The default node configuration is optimized for most common scenarios. But you
can fine-tune the settings to match your specific requirements.

We recommend beginning with learning [how the node configuration
process](/explanations/configuration) works, and then browse the [example
configuration](/reference/node/configuration) for tuning knobs.

Here are few common configuration scenarios.

## Accept incoming connections

When your node starts it will listen for node-to-node connections on the TCP
endpoint `127.0.0.1:5158`. Select a different endpoint via the `tenzir.endpoint`
option. For example, to bind to an IPv6 address use `[::1]:42000`.

## Refuse incoming connections

Set `tenzir.endpoint` to `false` to disable the endpoint, making the node
exclusively accessible through the Tenzir Platform. This effectively prevents
connections from other `tenzir` or `tenzir-node` processes.

## Configure pipeline subprocesses

Pipelines that run in a node can be partially moved to a subprocess for
improved error resilience and resource utilization. Operators that need to
communicate with a component still run inside the main node process for
architectural reasons. Set `tenzir.pipeline-subprocesses: true` in
`tenzir.yaml` or `TENZIR_PIPELINE_SUBPROCESSES=true` on the command line to
enable this feature, which is disabled by default.

Learn more about [pipeline subprocesses](/explanations/node#pipeline-subprocesses)
and their trade-offs.

## Specifically configure the Platform TLS connection

By default, the platform connection uses TLS and will pick up the settings from
the configurations section `tenzir.tls`. See [Configure TLS](/guides/node-setup/configure-tls)
for all available TLS options.

If you need to, you can configure TLS settings for the platform connection
specifically:

```yaml title="tenzir.yaml"
plugins:
  platform:
    tls-min-version: "1.2"
    tls-ciphers: "HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5"
```

The `tls-ciphers` option uses [OpenSSL cipher list
syntax](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man1/ciphers.html). The example
above selects high-strength ciphers while excluding those without authentication
(`!aNULL`) and those using MD5 (`!MD5`).
