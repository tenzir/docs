title: Configure a node
---

The default node configuration is optimized for most common scenarios. But you
can fine-tune the settings to match your specific requirements.

We recommend beginning with learning [how the node configuration
process](/explanations/configuration) works, and then browse the [example
configuration](/reference/node/configuration) for tuning knobs.

Here are few common configuration scenarios.

## Accept incoming connections

When your node starts it will listen for node-to-node connections on the TCP
endpoint `127.0.0.1:5158`. Select a different endpoint via the `tenzir.endpoint`
option. For example, to bind to an IPv6 address use `[::1]:42000`.

## Refuse incoming connections

Set `tenzir.endpoint` to `false` to disable the endpoint, making the node
exclusively accessible through the Tenzir Platform. This effectively prevents
connections from other `tenzir` or `tenzir-node` processes.

## Configure pipeline subprocesses

Pipelines that run in a node are now partially moved to a subprocess for
improved error resilience and resource utilization. Operators that need to
communicate with a component still run inside the main node process for
architectural reasons. You can set `tenzir.disable-forked-pipelines: true` in
`tenzir.yaml` or `TENZIR_DISABLE_FORKED_PIPELINES=true` on the command line to
opt out. This feature is enabled by default on Linux.

and their trade-offs.
