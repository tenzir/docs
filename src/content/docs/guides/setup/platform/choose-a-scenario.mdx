We provide several examples of possible platform deployment scenarios. Pick one
that best suits your needs.

## Download the Platform Files

Start with downloading the [latest Tenzir Platform
release](https://github.com/tenzir/platform/releases/latest) and unpack the
archive.

## Choose a Scenario

The `examples` directory contains example scenarios in the form of Docker
Compose configurations. Choose from the following options:

1. **keycloak**: TODO
2. **localdev**: TODO
3. **onprem**: TODO
4. **tenzir-developers**: TODO

In order to customize a scenario to your needs, configure the services by
populating a `.env` file with your settings as environment variables.
