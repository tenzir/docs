title: Blob Storage
---

**Blob storage** is a platform service for downloading data from nodes. When you
click the *Download* button in the Explorer, you get prompted with various
formats in which to download the data, such as JSON, CSV, Parquet, and more.
Once you initiate the download, a pipeline writes the requested data into the
platform's blob storage.
