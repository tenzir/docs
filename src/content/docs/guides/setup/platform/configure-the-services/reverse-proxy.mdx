title: Reverse Prxoy
---

The platform uses 4 URLs that require a HTTP reverse proxy. These URLs may be
mapped to the same or different hostnames.

1. The URL that the user's browser connects to, e.g.,
   `app.platform.example`. This serves a web frontend where the user can
   interact with the platform.
2. The URL that the nodes connect to, e.g., `nodes.platform.example`. Tenzir
   Nodes connect to this URL to establish long-running WebSocket connections.
3. The URL that the platform's S3-compatible blob storage is accessible at,
   e.g., `downloads.platform.example`. When using the *Download* button
   the platform generates download links under this URL.
4. The URL that the Tenzir Platform CLI connects to, e.g.,
   `api.platform.example`.

You must provide the following environment variables to the platform:

```sh
# The domain under which the platform frontend is reachable. Must include the
# `http://` or `https://` scheme.
TENZIR_PLATFORM_DOMAIN=https://app.platform.example

# The endpoint to which Tenzir nodes should connect. Must include the `ws://`
# or `wss://` scheme.
TENZIR_PLATFORM_CONTROL_ENDPOINT=wss://nodes.platform.example

# The URL at which the platform's S3-compatible blob storage is accessible at.
TENZIR_PLATFORM_BLOBS_ENDPOINT=https://downloads.platform.example

# The URL at which the platform's S3-compatible blob storage is accessible at.
TENZIR_PLATFORM_API_ENDPOINT=https://api.platform.example
```
