title: Run the platform
---

## Set up Docker registry access

As part of your Sovereign Edition distribution, we provided you with an
authentication token (`YOUR_DOCKER_TOKEN` below) to fetch the Docker images.

Log in with the token as follows:

```bash
echo YOUR_DOCKER_TOKEN | docker login ghcr.io -u tenzir-distribution --password-stdin
```

You are now ready to pull the images.

## Start the platform

Once you have [configured all platform services](../configure-the-platform) and
created a `docker-compose.yaml`, start the platform in the foreground with

```sh
docker compose up
```

or in the background with `docker compose up --detach`.
