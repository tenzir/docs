title: Ansible
---

The Ansible role for Tenzir allows for easy integration of Tenzir into
existing Ansible setups. The role uses either the Tenzir Debian package or
the tarball installation method depending on which is appropriate for the
target environment. The role definition is in the
[`ansible/roles/tenzir`][tenzir-repo-ansible] directory of the Tenzir
repository. You need a local copy of this directory so you can use it in your
playbook.

## Example

This example playbook shows how to run a Tenzir service on the machine
`example_tenzir_server`:

```yaml
- name: Deploy Tenzir
  become: true
  hosts: example_tenzir_server
  remote_user: example_ansible_user
  roles:
    - role: tenzir
      vars:
        tenzir_config_dir: ./tenzir
        tenzir_read_write_paths: [ /tmp ]
        tenzir_archive: ./tenzir.tar.gz
        tenzir_debian_package: ./tenzir.deb
```

## Variables

relative to the playbook.

### `tenzir_read_write_paths`
