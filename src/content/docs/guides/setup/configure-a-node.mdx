title: Configure a node
---

See the documentation on [configuration
files](../../explanations/configuration#configuration-files) along with the
example configuration to understand how you can configure yoru node.

## Accept incoming connections

When your node starts it will listen for node-to-node connections on the TCP
endpoint `127.0.0.1:5158`. Select a different endpoint via the `tenzir.endpoint`
option. For example, to bind to an IPv6 address use `[::1]:42000`.

## Refuse incoming connections

Set `tenzir.endpoint` to `false` to disable the endpoint, making the node
exclusively accessible through the Tenzir Platform. This effectively prevents
connections from other `tenzir` or `tenzir-node` processes.
