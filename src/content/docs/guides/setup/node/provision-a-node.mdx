title: Provision a node
---

Provisioning a node creates one in the
[platform](../../../../explanations/architecture/platform) and gives you a
configuration file with an authentication tokenâ€”ready to deploy.

Here's how to provision a self-hosted node:

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Steps>

1. Go to [app.tenzir.com/pipelines](https://app.tenzir.com/pipelines).
1. Click **Add node** in the left pane, and choose **Self-hosted node**.
1. Enter a name and click **Add node**.

</Steps>

The easiest way to continue is by spinning up a node with
[Docker](../deploy-a-node/docker).
