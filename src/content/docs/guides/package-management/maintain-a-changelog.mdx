title: Maintain a changelog
---

This guide shows you how to manage changelog entries and publish releases with
[`tenzir-ship`](/reference/ship-framework). You'll learn the complete workflow
from adding your first entry to publishing a release on GitHub.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or newer
- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed locally
- Access to the repository that hosts the changelog files

## Quick start

Create your first changelog entry to scaffold the project:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship add
```

The wizard will guide you through the process of creating a new changelog entry.
It will ask you for the title, type, and description of the change, as well as
the author.

The first invocation creates a `changelog/` subdirectory with `config.yaml` and
`unreleased/`, inferring sensible defaults from the parent directory name—no
separate bootstrap step required. When you provide an explicit `--root` flag,
the CLI uses that directory directly instead of creating a subdirectory.
Changelog projects that already expose `package.yaml` next to their `changelog/`
directory reuse the package `id` and `name` automatically, so the CLI creates no
extra files.

View the current changelog for your working tree:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship show
```

The default table lists every entry with row numbers, making it easy to
reference specific items. Row numbers count backward from the newest entry, so
`#1` always targets the latest change.

Inspect a card layout with `uvx tenzir-ship show --card 1` or export release
notes with `uvx tenzir-ship show v0.2.0 --release --markdown`.

Add entries as you prepare pull requests:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship add \
  --title "Introduce pipeline builder" \
  --type feature \
  --pr 101
```

Pass flags for authors, projects, and descriptions to avoid interactive prompts,
or provide the details interactively when prompted—there is no GitHub
auto-detection.

## Daily development workflow

### Add entries for pull requests

Run `uvx tenzir-ship add` while preparing pull requests to capture changes:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship add \
  --title "Fix authentication timeout" \
  --type bugfix \
  --description "Resolves session expiry issue." \
  --pr 102
```

The CLI prompts for missing information interactively. Use one-key shortcuts for
change types: `0` for breaking, `1` for feature, `2` for bugfix, `3` for change.

### Add co-authors

Use `--co-author` to credit additional contributors alongside the automatically
inferred author:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship add \
  --title "Implement caching layer" \
  --type feature \
  --co-author claude
```

This is ideal for AI-assisted development, pair programming, or collaborative
contributions. The CLI infers the primary author from environment variables or
the GitHub CLI, then appends co-authors in the order you specify:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship add \
  --title "Refactor authentication" \
  --type change \
  --co-author claude \
  --co-author copilot \
  --pr 150
```

You can also combine `--author` with `--co-author` to set the primary author
explicitly:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship add \
  --title "Fix race condition" \
  --type bugfix \
  --author alice \
  --co-author bob
```

### View pending changes

List all unreleased entries:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship show
```

Show detailed information for a specific entry:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship show --card 1
```

The card view displays detailed metadata and the full entry body:

```text
❯ tenzir-ship show --card 1
╭─ 🐞 Normalize release note paragraphs ───────────────────────────────────╮
│ Entry ID:  normalize-release-note-paragraphs                             │
│ Type:      bugfix                                                        │

╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

Filter by project when working with multiple projects:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship show --project core
```

### Validate changelog structure

Run validation checks to catch issues early:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship validate
```

The validator reports missing metadata, unused entries, duplicate entry IDs, and
configuration drift. Add this to CI pipelines to enforce metadata completeness.

### View project statistics

Get an overview of your project's release history and entry distribution:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship stats
```

Single projects show a vertical card layout with sections for project metadata,
releases, entry types, and status. Multi-module projects display a compact table
comparing all modules.

Export statistics as JSON for automation:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship stats --json
```

## Release workflow

### Create a release

Preview the release before committing changes:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship release create v5.4.0
```

The command shows which entries will be included and performs a dry run. When
the summary looks good, re-run with `--yes` to commit the changes:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship release create v5.4.0 --yes
```

This moves entries from `unreleased/` to `releases/v5.4.0/entries/`, generates
`notes.md`, and updates `manifest.yaml`.

Use version bump shortcuts instead of typing the full version:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship release create --patch --yes
uvx tenzir-ship release create --minor --yes
uvx tenzir-ship release create --major --yes
```

Add an inline intro summary:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship release create v5.4.0 \
  --intro "Major stability improvements." \
  --yes
```

Alternatively, provide intro content from a file:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship release create v5.4.0 \
  --intro-file intro.md \
  --yes
```

The intro file can include Markdown links, call-outs, or image references. The
command embeds its content in `manifest.yaml` and includes it in `notes.md`.

### Export release notes

Export release notes for a specific version:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship show v5.4.0 --release --markdown
```

Export as JSON for programmatic use:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship show v5.4.0 --release --json
```

Use compact format for bullet-list layout:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship show v5.4.0 --release --compact --markdown
```

Preview unreleased entries as if they were already released:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship show --release --markdown
```

Export all releases in a single invocation for batch processing:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship show all --release --json
```

This exports every release as a JSON array, useful for documentation sync
scripts that need all release data at once.

### Publish to GitHub

Publish directly from the changelog project using the CLI:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship release publish v5.4.0 --yes
```

Include tagging and pushing via the CLI:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship release publish v5.4.0 --tag --yes
```

Draft or prerelease variants:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship release publish v5.4.0 --draft --yes
uvx tenzir-ship release publish v5.4.0 --prerelease --yes
```

:::note[Terminology]
We use the verb "publish" in prose even though the GitHub CLI subcommand to
create a release is `gh release create`. If you created a draft first, you can
publish it with `gh release edit v5.4.0 --draft=false`.

## End-to-end Walkthrough

This walkthrough shows how to initialize a repository, add entries, preview the
backlog, and publish a release manifest with custom introductory content.

### Create a project

Initialize a new changelog project from your project root:

```sh
cd my-project
uvx tenzir-ship add \
  --title "Add pipeline builder" \
  --type feature \
  --description "Introduces the new pipeline builder UI." \
  --author alice \
  --pr 101
```

The first `add` invocation scaffolds the project automatically, creating a
`changelog/` subdirectory—no manual config editing needed. After the command
completes, inspect `changelog/config.yaml` (or update `package.yaml` if you're
using the package layout):

```yaml
id: my-project
name: My Project
```

### Capture entries

Record additional changes with authors and pull request numbers:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship add \
  --title "Fix ingest crash" \
  --type bugfix \
  --description "Resolves ingest worker crash when tokens expire." \
  --author bob \
  --pr 102 \
  --pr 115

uvx tenzir-ship add \
  --title "Improve CLI help" \
  --type change \
  --description "Tweaks command descriptions for clarity." \
  --author carol \
  --pr 103
```

Each invocation writes a Markdown file inside `changelog/unreleased/`. For
example, `add-pipeline-builder.md` looks like:

```markdown
---
title: Add pipeline builder
type: feature
author: alice
created: 2025-10-16T09:30:00Z
pr: 101
---

Introduces the new pipeline builder UI.
```

You can use either singular (`author`, `pr`, `component`) or plural (`authors`,
`prs`, `components`) keys. The singular form is shorthand for single values.

If an entry spans multiple pull requests, repeat `--pr` during `add`. The CLI
stores a `prs:` list in the generated frontmatter automatically.

### Preview the changelog

View all entries in table format:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship show
```

Inspect a detailed card for any entry:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship show --card 1
```

### Prepare release notes

Author an intro snippet that can include Markdown links, call-outs, or image
references. Save it as `intro.md`:

```markdown
Welcome to the first release of the Tenzir changelog!

![Release Overview](images/release-overview.png)

We cover breaking changes, highlights, upgrades, and fixes below.
```

### Cut the release

Create the release with the custom intro file:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship release create v0.1.0 \
  --intro-file intro.md \
  --yes
```

The tool writes release artifacts under `releases/v0.1.0/`:

- `manifest.yaml` records the release date and intro:

  ```yaml
  created: 2025-10-18
  intro: |-
    Welcome to the first release of the Tenzir changelog!

    ![Release Overview](images/release-overview.png)

    We cover breaking changes, highlights, upgrades, and fixes below.
  ```

- `notes.md` stitches together the intro and generated sections:

  ```markdown
  Welcome to the first release of the Tenzir changelog!

  ![Release Overview](images/release-overview.png)

  We cover breaking changes, highlights, upgrades, and fixes below.

  ## Features

  - **Add pipeline builder**: Introduces the new pipeline builder UI.

  ## Bug fixes

  - **Fix ingest crash**: Resolves ingest worker crash when tokens expire.

  ## Changes

  - **Improve CLI help**: Tweaks command descriptions for clarity.
  ```

- `entries/` contains the archived entry files moved from `unreleased/`.

### Validate the project

Verify everything is correct:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship validate
```

A clean run prints `All changelog files look good!`. You can remove `intro.md`
now that its content is embedded in the release file.

### Export the release

Print the release notes:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship show v0.1.0 --release --markdown
```

Export as JSON for programmatic use:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship show v0.1.0 --release --json
```

## Tips and best practices

- **Automate validation**: Add `uvx tenzir-ship validate` to CI pipelines
  to enforce metadata completeness before merging pull requests.
- **Use PR numbers**: Always include `--pr` when adding entries to link changes
  back to pull requests for traceability.
- **Keep entries concise**: Write clear, action-oriented summaries. Save
  detailed explanations for the entry body.
- **Review before publishing**: Always preview releases with
  `release create <version>` (without `--yes`) before committing changes.
- **Custom intros for major releases**: Use `--intro-file` for major releases to
  provide context, migration guides, or highlight key changes.
- **Document components deliberately**: When you configure a `components`
  allowlist, reuse the same labels consistently across entries and filters.

## Troubleshooting

- **Validation failures**: Run `uvx tenzir-ship validate` to identify
  specific issues. Common problems include missing required fields, duplicate
  entry IDs, or unused entry files.
- **Component mismatch**: If you configured `components`, ensure entries either
  omit the `component` field or use one of the allowed labels.
- **Configuration not found**: Ensure `config.yaml` exists in the changelog root
  or `package.yaml` sits next to the `changelog/` directory. Run
  `uvx tenzir-ship add` once to scaffold the configuration.
- **Version bump fails**: Bump flags read the most recent release manifest on
  disk. Create an initial release with an explicit version before using
  `--patch/--minor/--major`.
