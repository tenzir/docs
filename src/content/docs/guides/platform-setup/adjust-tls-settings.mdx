title: Adjust TLS Settings
---

We strongly recommend using signed TLS certificates which are trusted by the
machines running the Tenzir Nodes.

## Self-signed Certificates

However, it can sometimes be necessary to use self-signed certificates for the
Tenzir Platform. in this situation we recommend the creation of a local
certificate authority, e.g., using the
[trustme](https://pypi.org/project/trustme/) project. This approach has the
advantage of not requiring the client to disable TLS certificate validation,
thus preventing man-in-the-middle attacks when compared to a self-signed
certificate.

If that is not possible, a self-signed certificate can be generated using `openssl`
by following [this procedure](https://stackoverflow.com/a/10176685/92560).

## Node Settings

On the node, in order to trust a custom CA certificate, the following option
needs to point to a CA certificate file in PEM format without password protection:

```sh
TENZIR_PLATFORM_CACERT=/path/to/ca-certificate.pem
```

If you want to use a self-signed TLS certificate, you need to disable
TLS certificate validation by setting:

```sh
TENZIR_PLATFORM_SKIP_PEER_VERIFICATION=true
```

Note that these settings only apply to the connection that is established
between the node and the platform, not to any TLS connections that may
be created by running pipelines on the node.
