title: Configure reverse proxy
---

This guide shows you how to configure a reverse proxy for the Tenzir Platform.
The proxy terminates TLS and routes traffic to these four entry points:

1. **Tenzir UI**: The URL your browser connects to, e.g., `app.platform.example`.
   This serves the web frontend where you interact with the platform.
2. **Tenzir Gateway**: The URL nodes connect to, e.g., `nodes.platform.example`.
   Tenzir Nodes connect to this URL to establish long-running WebSocket
   connections.
3. **Blob Storage**: The URL where the platform's S3-compatible blob storage is
   accessible, e.g., `downloads.platform.example`. When you click the _Download_
   button, the platform generates download links under this URL. When you drag
   files into the explorer window, the platform stores them here so that Tenzir
   Nodes can access them.
4. **Platform API**: The URL the Tenzir Platform CLI connects to, e.g.,
   `api.platform.example`.

The typical setup for the Tenzir Platform uses a reverse proxy to terminate
TLS connections and forward incoming traffic to the correct services. The choice
of technology varies with your deployment scenario and ranges from an additional
[Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/getting-started/install-traefik/) container
within the Docker Compose stack, over an nginx instance running on the same host,
to global load balancing services offered by a commercial cloud provider.

In our example scenarios, set the following environment variables to configure
these four endpoints:

```sh
# The domain under which the platform frontend is reachable.
# Must include the `http://` or `https://` scheme.
TENZIR_PLATFORM_UI_ENDPOINT=https://app.platform.example

# The endpoint to which Tenzir nodes should connect.
# Must include the `ws://` or `wss://` scheme.
TENZIR_PLATFORM_NODES_ENDPOINT=wss://nodes.platform.example

# The URL at which the platform's S3-compatible blob storage is accessible.
TENZIR_PLATFORM_DOWNLOADS_ENDPOINT=https://downloads.platform.example

# The URL at which the platform API is accessible.
TENZIR_PLATFORM_API_ENDPOINT=https://api.platform.example
```

## Native TLS

A reverse proxy typically runs on the same host as other platform containers
and terminates TLS. When you can't guarantee that the reverse proxy runs on
the same host as other platform containers, or when you deploy the containers to
different machines, enable native TLS support for individual platform
containers.

### Obtaining Certificates

Purchase the domain name you want for the platform and use one of the globally
trusted certificate authorities (CAs) to obtain a valid certificate. This
approach provides the most straightforward and recommended certificate
acquisition method.

If you run the platform in a private or air-gapped network, use methods like
the DNS challenge offered by [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) and
other providers to generate a certificate and transfer it to the target machine.

When you can't use a globally trusted CA, use a corporate root CA instead.
Naturally, certificates from this CA will only be trusted inside your
organization or your Tenzir Platform setup.

If you don't possess a corporate root CA, create a private CA for yourself.
Signing and provisioning root certificates is a complex task, so we recommend
using a tool like `trustme` for this purpose.

We provide a [sample
script](https://github.com/tenzir/platform/tree/main/examples/native-tls) that
shows how to create the necessary certificates for all components.

:::caution[Certificate Validation Idiosyncrasies]
Some libraries ignore the system-wide CA certificate store and use alternative,
more strictly curated bundles. For example, Mozilla's NSS root store is a
popular choice. Additionally, the operating system's default certificate
bundles shipped within our Docker containers won't trust private CAs by
default. Therefore, when you use a private CA, perform the same configuration
for corporate root CAs from a publicly trusted CA or your self-created private
CA.
:::

### Self-signed Certificates

Instead of creating a private CA, create a self-signed certificate that combines
certificate and CA in a single file.

This approach simplifies setup and management compared to a private CA, but
reduces security guarantees. For example, it nullifies several TLS security
guarantees and provides only protection against passive eavesdropping.

Below we assume you store valid TLS certificates in files named
`ssl/app-cert.pem`, `ssl/platform-cert.pem`, etc., where each file contains
both the TLS certificate and private key. If you store the certificate and
private key in separate files, mount both into the containers and adjust the
environment variables to point towards the correct file.

When you use a private CA, store the public key of that CA in the file
`ssl/ca.pem`.

#### Tenzir UI

To have the Tenzir UI serve its traffic using TLS, add the following environment
variables and volumes to your `docker-compose.yaml`:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    environment:
      - TLS_CERTFILE=/ssl/app-cert.pem
      - TLS_KEYFILE=/ssl/app-cert.pem

    volumes:
      - ./ssl/app-cert.pem:/ssl/app-cert.pem
```

When you use a private CA, add the following configuration:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    environment:
      - NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt

    volumes:
      - ./ssl/ca.pem:/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
```

#### Tenzir Gateway

To enable TLS serving for the gateway, mount the certificate into the container
and set the `TLS_CERTFILE` and `TLS_KEYFILE` environment variables:

```yaml
services:
  websocket-gateway:
    environment:
      - TLS_CERTFILE=/ssl/gateway-cert.pem
      - TLS_KEYFILE=/ssl/gateway-cert.pem
    volumes:
      - ./ssl/gateway-cert.pem:/ssl/gateway-cert.pem
```

When you use a private CA, add the following configuration:

```yaml
services:
  websocket-gateway:
    environment:
      - TLS_CAFILE=/ssl/ca.pem
    volumes:
      - ./ssl/ca.pem:/ssl/ca.pem
```

#### Platform API

To enable TLS serving for the Platform API, mount the certificate into the
container and set the `TLS_CERTFILE` and `TLS_KEYFILE` environment variables.
This follows the same process as for the `websocket-gateway` container:

```yaml
services:
  platform:
    environment:
      - TLS_CERTFILE=/ssl/platform-cert.pem
      - TLS_KEYFILE=/ssl/platform-cert.pem
    volumes:
      - ./ssl/platform-cert.pem:/ssl/platform-cert.pem
```

When you use a private CA, add the following configuration:

```yaml
services:
  platform:
    environment:
      # 'requests' uses a baked-in CA bundle, so point it to our CA explicitly.
      - REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
      - SSL_CERT_FILE=/ssl/ca.pem
    volumes:
      - ./ssl/ca.pem:/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
```

### Example

Refer to our [native TLS example](https://github.com/tenzir/platform/tree/main/examples/native-tls) for a
complete configuration example, including the native TLS setup for the default
bundled database, S3 storage and IdP services.

## Node TLS Settings

Nodes connect to the platform using the Tenzir Gateway via a TLS connection.
When using a custom certificate for the gateway, provide it to the node to
successfully establish a connection.

Set the following option to point to a CA certificate file in PEM format
without password protection:

```sh
TENZIR_PLATFORM_CACERT=/path/to/ca-certificate.pem
```

When using a self-signed TLS certificate, additionally disable TLS certificate
validation:

```sh
TENZIR_PLATFORM_SKIP_PEER_VERIFICATION=true
```

:::note[TLS: Platform vs. pipeline]
These settings apply only to the connection that the node establishes with the
platform, not to any TLS connections that pipelines may create within the node.
