title: Configure internal services
---

This guide shows you how to configure the three internal Tenzir services: the
UI, Gateway, and Platform API. You'll set environment variables that control
authentication, connectivity, and feature settings.

The platform runs as a set of containers in a Docker Compose stack. The
[example files](https://github.com/tenzir/platform/tree/main/examples) read
configuration parameters from environment variables.

Create a file named `.env` in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yaml` file,
and set the environment variables described below.

## Tenzir Platform API

This section describes how to configure the Tenzir Platform API.

### Admin rules

The platform distinguishes between _regular_ and _admin_ users. Admin users can
create new workspaces and view, edit, and delete all existing workspaces.

Currently, only admin users can create shared workspaces by creating a new workspace
and editing the access rules.

Configure admin users by providing a list of authentication rules. The platform
considers any user who matches the provided rules an admin and allows them to use
the `tenzir-platform admin` CLI commands.

Use the `tenzir-platform tools print-auth-rule` CLI command to generate valid rules
for insertion here.

```sh
# Make everybody an admin.
# Use for deployments with few users who fully trust each other.
TENZIR_PLATFORM_ADMIN_RULES=[{"auth_fn":"auth_allow_all"}]

# Make the two users with IDs `google-oauth2:12345678901` and
# `google-oauth2:12345678902` admins of this platform instance.
TENZIR_PLATFORM_ADMIN_RULES=[{"auth_fn":"auth_user","user_id":"google-oauth2:12345678901"}, {"auth_fn":"auth_user","user_id":"google-oauth2:12345678902"}]
```

### Random seeds

The platform requires random strings for encryption functions. Generate these strings
with a secure random number generator and use unique values for each platform instance.

```sh
# Random string to encrypt frontend cookies.
# Generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`.
TENZIR_PLATFORM_INTERNAL_AUTH_SECRET=

# Random string to generate user keys.
# Generate with `openssl rand 32 | base64`.
TENZIR_PLATFORM_INTERNAL_TENANT_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY=

# Random string for the app to access restricted API endpoints.
# Generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`.
TENZIR_PLATFORM_INTERNAL_APP_API_KEY=
```

### Node blob storage configuration

:::note[Advanced Topic]
This is an advanced setting mostly relevant for enterprise use cases.
You can most likely skip it when you first set up the Tenzir Platform.
:::

When the Tenzir UI and Tenzir Nodes run in separate networks, the nodes may need to use a
different URL to reach the blob storage service from the one the UI uses.

For example, the Tenzir UI may run on a browser of a remote employee, who
accesses the configured blob storage via `https://downloads.example.com`.
However, the nodes may run in a strictly regulated network that only allows
access to the outside world through a reverse proxy. In this example, these
nodes would have to talk to `https://downloads.corporate-proxy.example.com`.
To allow both sides to use different URLs to talk to the same blob storage
service, you can override the public endpoint.

Use the `BLOB_STORAGE__NODES_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT_URL` environment variable to
override the URL that nodes use to access S3-compatible blob storage.
Note that you need to add this variable to the `platform` container directly,
since it currently doesn't appear in any of the example setups:

```sh
# Override the blob storage URL for nodes
BLOB_STORAGE__NODES_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT_URL=https://s3.internal.example.com
```

This setting is particularly useful when:

- Nodes run in a separate network from the Tenzir UI
- Internal DNS resolution differs between the UI and node networks
- You need to route node traffic through specific network paths

## Tenzir UI

This section describes how to configure the Tenzir Platform UI.

### Internal proxy

:::note[Advanced Topic]
This is an advanced setting mostly relevant for enterprise use cases.
You can most likely skip it when you first set up the Tenzir Platform.
:::

By default, the Tenzir UI sends requests directly from the browser to the Tenzir Gateway
to query the status of connected nodes. This setup can cause problems in some network
topologies, especially in zero-trust networks where accessing the Tenzir Gateway
requires additional authentication headers.

Enable the internal proxy to route these requests through the Tenzir UI backend
instead, which makes all requests from the Tenzir UI frontend go to the same domain.
This approach adds some latency through an additional proxy hop.

```sh
TENZIR_PLATFORM_USE_INTERNAL_WS_PROXY=true
```

### External JWT authentication

:::note[Advanced Topic]
This is an advanced setting mostly relevant for enterprise use cases.
You can most likely skip it when you first set up the Tenzir Platform.
:::

The Tenzir Platform supports accepting externally-supplied JWTs from HTTP
headers, which is useful when running behind authentication proxies like
Google Cloud IAP or other enterprise authentication systems.

Configure the `app` service to accept JWTs from a specific HTTP header.
Note that you need to add this variable to the `app` container directly,
since it currently doesn't appear in any of the example setups:

```sh
# Accept JWTs from the specified HTTP header
PRIVATE_JWT_FROM_HEADER=X-Goog-IAP-JWT-Assertion
```

When you set this variable, the platform bypasses the normal OIDC login flow
and instead validates the JWT token provided in the specified header.

You must also configure the trusted issuers and audiences to match the values
that the external JWT contains using the `TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_TRUSTED_AUDIENCES`
environment variable for the Tenzir Platform API.

For more information about external JWT configuration, see the
[external JWT authentication section](/guides/platform-setup/configure-identity-provider#external-jwt-authentication)
in the identity provider configuration guide.

## Tenzir Gateway

The Tenzir Gateway doesn't offer any user-controlled settings at the moment.
