title: Configure internal services
---

This guide explains how to configure the three internal Tenzir services: the Tenzir UI,
the Tenzir Gateway, and the Tenzir Platform API. These core platform services require
internal configuration.

The platform runs as a set of containers in a Docker Compose stack. The
[example files](https://github.com/tenzir/platform/tree/main/examples) read
configuration parameters from environment variables.

Create a file named `.env` in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yaml` file,
and set the environment variables described below.

## Tenzir Platform API

This section describes how to configure the Tenzir Platform API.

### Admin rules

The platform distinguishes between _regular_ and _admin_ users. Admin users can
create new workspaces and view, edit, and delete all existing workspaces.

Currently, only admin users can create shared workspaces by creating a new workspace
and editing the access rules.

Configure admin users by providing a list of authentication rules. The platform
considers any user who matches the provided rules an admin and allows them to use
the `tenzir-platform admin` CLI commands.

Use the `tenzir-platform tools print-auth-rule` CLI command to generate valid rules
for insertion here.

```sh
# Make everybody an admin.
# Use for deployments with few users who fully trust each other.
TENZIR_PLATFORM_ADMIN_RULES=[{"auth_fn":"auth_allow_all"}]

# Make the two users with IDs `google-oauth2:12345678901` and
# `google-oauth2:12345678902` admins of this platform instance.
TENZIR_PLATFORM_ADMIN_RULES=[{"auth_fn":"auth_user","user_id":"google-oauth2:12345678901"}, {"auth_fn":"auth_user","user_id":"google-oauth2:12345678902"}]
```

### Random seeds

The platform requires random strings for encryption functions. Generate these strings
with a secure random number generator and use unique values for each platform instance.

```sh
# Random string to encrypt frontend cookies.
# Generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`.
TENZIR_PLATFORM_INTERNAL_AUTH_SECRET=

# Random string to generate user keys.
# Generate with `openssl rand 32 | base64`.
TENZIR_PLATFORM_INTERNAL_TENANT_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY=

# Random string for the app to access restricted API endpoints.
# Generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`.
TENZIR_PLATFORM_INTERNAL_APP_API_KEY=
```

## Tenzir UI

This section describes how to configure the Tenzir Platform UI.

### Internal proxy

By default, the Tenzir UI sends requests directly from the browser to the Tenzir Gateway
to query the status of connected nodes. This setup can cause problems in some network
topologies, especially in zero-trust networks where accessing the Tenzir Gateway
requires additional authentication headers.

Enable the internal proxy to route these requests through the Tenzir UI Backend
instead, making all requests from the Tenzir UI Frontend go to the same domain.
This approach adds some latency through an additional proxy hop.

```sh
TENZIR_PLATFORM_USE_INTERNAL_WS_PROXY=true
```

## Tenzir Gateway

The Tenzir Gateway does not offer any user-controlled settings at the moment.
