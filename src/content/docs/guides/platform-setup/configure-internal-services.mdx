title: Configure internal services
---

This guide covers configuration for the three internal Tenzir services: the
**Tenzir UI**, **Tenzir Gateway**, and **Platform API**. These are the core
platform services provided by Tenzir that require internal configuration.

The platform runs as a set of containers in a Docker Compose stack. Our
[example files](https://github.com/tenzir/platform/tree/main/examples) read
configuration parameters from environment variables.

Create a file named `.env` in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yaml`
file and set the environment variables described below.

## Admin Rules

The platform distinguishes between _regular_ and _admin_ users. Admin users can
create new workspaces and view, edit, and delete all existing workspaces.

Currently, only admins can create shared workspaces by creating a new workspace
and editing the access rules.

Configure admins by providing a list of authentication rules. The platform
considers any user matching the provided rules an admin and allows them to use
the `tenzir-platform admin` CLI commands.

Use the `tenzir-platform tools print-auth-rule` CLI command to generate valid
rules for insertion here.

```sh
# Make everybody an admin.
# Use for deployments with few users who fully trust each other.
TENZIR_PLATFORM_ADMIN_RULES=[{"auth_fn":"auth_allow_all"}]

# Make the two users with IDs `google-oauth2:12345678901` and
# `google-oauth2:12345678902` admins of this platform instance.
TENZIR_PLATFORM_ADMIN_RULES=[{"auth_fn":"auth_user","user_id":"google-oauth2:12345678901"}, {"auth_fn":"auth_user","user_id":"google-oauth2:12345678902"}]
```

## Random Seeds

The platform requires random strings for encryption functions. Generate these
from a secure random number generator and use unique values for each platform
instance.

```sh
# Random string to encrypt frontend cookies.
# Generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`.
TENZIR_PLATFORM_INTERNAL_AUTH_SECRET=

# Random string to generate user keys.
# Generate with `openssl rand 32 | base64`.
TENZIR_PLATFORM_INTERNAL_TENANT_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY=

# Random string for the app to access restricted API endpoints.
# Generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`.
TENZIR_PLATFORM_INTERNAL_APP_API_KEY=
```

## Internal Proxy

By default, the Tenzir UI sends requests directly from the browser to the
Tenzir Gateway to query connected node status. This can cause problems in some
network topologies, particularly in zero-trust networks where accessing the
Tenzir Gateway requires additional authentication headers.

Enable the internal proxy to route these requests through the Tenzir UI Backend
instead, making all requests from the Tenzir UI Frontend go to the same domain.
This approach adds some latency through an additional proxy hop.

```sh
TENZIR_PLATFORM_USE_INTERNAL_WS_PROXY=true
```
