title: Choose a scenario
---

We provide several examples of possible platform deployment scenarios. Pick one
that best suits your needs.

## Download the platform files

Start with downloading the [latest Tenzir Platform
release](https://github.com/tenzir/platform/releases/latest) and unpack the
archive.

## Choose a scenario

The `examples` directory contains example scenarios in the form of Docker
Compose configurations. Choose from the following options:

1. **localdev**: This scenario is designed for local development and testing
   purposes. It operates as a "Tenzir-in-a-box," meaning all necessary
   components are bundled together for a quick and easy setup, making it ideal
   for single-user exploration and experimentation. Due to its simplified nature
   and focus on ease of use, it has a low barrier to entry. However, it is not
   optimized for performance, security, or scalability, making it ill-suited for
   production environments.
2. **keycloak**: The `keycloak` scenario provides a minimal yet complete setup
   for multi-user environments. It integrates Keycloak for robust authentication
   and authorization, enabling secure access for multiple users. This
   configuration includes all essential Tenzir services and is designed to be
   readily usable, especially when deployed behind a reverse proxy, which can
   handle TLS termination and provide an additional layer of security and load
   balancing.
3. **onprem**: Our `onprem` scenario represents an enterprise-grade deployment.
   It is structured with the assumption that critical services such as Kafka,
   S3, and the identity provider (like Keycloak) are already established and
   managed externally within your on-premises infrastructure. This allows Tenzir
   to integrate seamlessly into existing robust, production-ready environments,
   leveraging your organization's established operational practices and
   infrastructure investments.

In order to customize a scenario to your needs, configure the services by
populating a `.env` file with your settings as environment variables.
