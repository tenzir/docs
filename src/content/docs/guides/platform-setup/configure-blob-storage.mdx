title: Configure blob storage
---

**Blob storage** is a platform service for exchanging files between the platform
and nodes. It facilitates not only downloading data from nodes, but also
uploading files from your browser to the platform.

For example, when you click the *Download* button in the Explorer, you get
prompted with various formats in which to download the data, such as JSON, CSV,
Parquet, and more. Once you initiate the download, a pipeline writes the
requested data into the platform's blob storage. Similarly, when you drag files
into the Explorer, they upload to the platform for use as pipeline inputs by
nodes.

The following variables contol the blob storage service:

```sh
TENANT_MANAGER_SIDEPATH_BUCKET_NAME=${TENZIR_PLATFORM_INTERNAL_BUCKET_NAME}
BLOB_STORAGE__ENDPOINT_URL=http://seaweed:8333
BLOB_STORAGE__PUBLIC_ENDPOINT_URL=${TENZIR_PLATFORM_DOWNLOADS_ENDPOINT}
BLOB_STORAGE__ACCESS_KEY_ID=${TENZIR_PLATFORM_INTERNAL_ACCESS_KEY_ID}
BLOB_STORAGE__SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=${TENZIR_PLATFORM_INTERNAL_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}
```
