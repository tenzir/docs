title: Configure blob storage
---

The **blob storage** is a platform service for exchanging files between the
platform and nodes. It facilitates not only downloading data from nodes, but
also uploading files from your browser to the platform.

For example, when you click the _Download_ button in the Explorer, you get
prompted with various formats in which to download the data, such as JSON, CSV,
Parquet, and more. Once you initiate the download, a pipeline writes the
requested data into the platform's blob storage. Similarly, when you drag files
into the Explorer, they upload to the platform for use as pipeline inputs by
nodes.

The following variables contol the blob storage service:

```sh
TENZIR_PLATFORM_DOWNLOADS_ENDPOINT=
TENZIR_PLATFORM_INTERNAL_BUCKET_NAME=
TENZIR_PLATFORM_INTERNAL_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
TENZIR_PLATFORM_INTERNAL_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
```

When using S3 or another external blob storage, the bucket must exist and
the access key must be valid and must have read and write permissions on the
bucket.

When using the bundled seaweed instance, these values can be set to arbitrary
strings. The bundled seaweed container will be automatically generated to
contain a bucket with the configured name and access key.
