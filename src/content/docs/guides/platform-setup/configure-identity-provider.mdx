title: Configure identity provider
---

The identity provider (IdP) handles authentication for the Tenzir Platform.
When you click the _Login_ button in the Tenzir UI, the system redirects you
to your chosen identity provider, which creates a signed token that certifies your
identity.

You can either use an external identity provider that's already set up inside
your organization, or run an identity provider that's bundled with our
example `docker-compose.yaml`.

The Tenzir Platform supports the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol for external
identity providers. Below, we describe the requirements for using a generic
identity provider, as well as two hands-on guides for setting up Keycloak
and Entra ID as identity providers for the Tenzir Platform.

## Generic Identity Provider

To use an external IdP, ensure that it supports the OIDC protocol, including the _OIDC
Discovery_ extension, and configure it to provide valid RS256 ID tokens.

Set up the external identity provider by creating two clients (also called
applications in Auth0, or app registrations in Microsoft Entra) named
`tenzir-app` and `tenzir-cli`.

The `tenzir-app` client handles logging into the Tenzir Platform in the web
browser.

- You must enable the **Authorization Code** flow.
- The allowed redirect URLs must include
  `https://app.platform.example/login/oauth/callback`.
- You should note down the client secret so you can add it to the configuration
  of the Tenzir Platform in the next step.

The `tenzir-cli` client handles authentication with the `tenzir-platform` CLI.

- You must enable the **Device Code** flow.
- The identity provider must either return an `id_token` for the device code
  flow, or an `access_token` in JWT format.

You may want to run CLI commands in environments where no user
is available to perform the device code authorization flow, for example
when you run CLI commands as part of a CI job.

In this case, you can set up another client with the **Client Credentials** flow
enabled. The `access_token` you obtain from this client must be in JWT format. The
CLI automatically attempts to use the client credentials flow if
the `TENZIR_PLATFORM_CLI_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variable is set. You can
also force the use of the client credentials flow by using the
`tenzir-platform auth login --non-interactive` option.

You must provide the following environment variables for the OIDC provider
configuration used for logging into the platform:

```sh
TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_PROVIDER_NAME=example-idp
TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_PROVIDER_ISSUER_URL=https://my.idp.example

TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_CLI_CLIENT_ID=tenzir-cli

TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_APP_CLIENT_ID=tenzir-app
TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_APP_CLIENT_SECRET=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

You must provide the following environment variable containing a JSON object
with the OIDC issuer and audiences that the platform should accept.

```sh
TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_TRUSTED_AUDIENCES='{"https://my.idp.example": ["tenzir-cli", "tenzir-app"]}'
```

## Keycloak

This section explains how to configure Keycloak as an external Identity Provider
for use with the Tenzir Platform.

We assume that you already have a Keycloak instance up and running that you can
reach with a browser.
We provide an example stack of the Tenzir Platform with a bundled Keycloak
instance [here](https://github.com/tenzir/platform/tree/main/examples/keycloak).
The remainder of this section assumes you're running this example stack, but
the setup is the same for any other Keycloak instance.

### Setting up the Keycloak Instance

#### Admin Login

Navigate to the Keycloak instance and log in as a user with admin permissions.
If you use the bundled Keycloak instance, the initial username is `admin`
and password is `changeme`.

Remember to change the default password after logging in for the first time,
and to set up 2-factor authentication for your admin user.

#### Create a new `tenzir` realm (optional)

Keycloak defaults to the `master` realm and the bundled Docker Compose
stack uses this realm by default.

If you want to use a different realm, or if you already have an existing one,
update the `TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_ISSUER_URL` variable to point to the
new realm instead.

![Configuration 0](configure-identity-provider/keycloak-create-realm.png)

#### Create a client for the app

Use the `Add Client` button in the `Clients` menu on the left. Configure the new
client as follows:

Under _General settings_, set the client type to _OpenID Connect_ and the
client ID to `tenzir-app`. If you use a different client ID,
remember to update the `TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_PROVIDER_CLIENT_ID` variable
in your Tenzir Platform configuration accordingly.

![Configuration 0](configure-identity-provider/keycloak-create-app-client-0.png)

Under _Capability config_, enable client authentication and the _Standard flow_
access method.

![Configuration 1](configure-identity-provider/keycloak-create-app-client-1.png)

Under _Login settings_, enter a redirect URL that points to `${TENZIR_PLATFORM_DOMAIN}/login/oauth/callback`,
where `TENZIR_PLATFORM_DOMAIN` is the domain you configure in your Tenzir Platform configuration.
For example, if the app runs under `https://tenzir-app.example.org` then this should be
`https://tenzir-app.example.org/login/oauth/callback`.

![Configuration 2](configure-identity-provider/keycloak-create-app-client-2.png)

Finally, in the client view, go to the Credentials tab and copy the value of
the generated client secret. You must add this to the Tenzir Platform configuration
under `TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_PROVIDER_CLIENT_SECRET`.

![Configuration 3](configure-identity-provider/keycloak-create-app-client-3.png)

### Create a client for the CLI

To use the `tenzir-platform` CLI, you need to set up an additional
client that supports device code authentication. (It's possible but not
recommended to use the same client for both the Tenzir UI and Tenzir Platform CLI)

To do this, proceed exactly as above, but use `tenzir-cli` as
the client ID and under _Capability config_ disable the _Client authentication_
setting and enable the _OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant_ authentication flow.

## Microsoft Entra Identity

To use Microsoft Entra Identity as an OIDC provider, you need to create two app
registrations in Entra ID and configure them for use with the Tenzir UI and the
Tenzir Platform CLI.

Follow these steps to create the required resources:

1. Navigate to `portal.azure.com` and open the page for "Microsoft Entra ID".

![Navigate to Entra](./configure-identity-provider/entra-oidc-navigate.png)

2. Open the "App registrations" sub page.

![Select App registrations](./configure-identity-provider/entra-oidc-app-registrations.png)

3. Create a new registration named `Tenzir Platform CLI`.

![Register CLI](./configure-identity-provider/entra-oidc-register-cli.png)

4. Enable the public client flows for this app.

![Enable public client flows](./configure-identity-provider/entra-oidc-cli-public-client-flows.png)

5. Create a second registration named `Tenzir UI`.

![Register UI](./configure-identity-provider/entra-oidc-register-ui.png)

6. For this registration, open "Certificates & Secrets".

![Navigate Secrets](./configure-identity-provider/entra-oidc-create-secret-1.png)

7. Create a new secret and give it a descriptive name.

![Create Secret](./configure-identity-provider/entra-oidc-create-secret-2.png)

8. Make a local copy of the secret value.

![Copy Secret](./configure-identity-provider/entra-oidc-copy-secret.png)

9. Copy the client id to your local machine.

![Copy Client ID](./configure-identity-provider/entra-oidc-client-id.png)

10. Copy the issuer url to your local machine.

![Copy Issuer URL](./configure-identity-provider/entra-oidc-issuer-url.png)

Now you can supply the created resources and values to the stack by editing
the `.env` file in your Compose folder:

```sh
TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_PROVIDER_NAME="Entra ID"

# The client id of the registration created in step 3.
TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_CLI_CLIENT_ID=082a9391-b645-4278-a16e-3cf54fb1bcf0

# The client id and secret created in steps 8 and 9.
TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_APP_CLIENT_SECRET=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_APP_CLIENT_ID=d8ea5612-6745-47bc-b9fe-5024b1ca18fe

# The issuer url copied in step 10.
TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_PROVIDER_ISSUER_URL=https://login.microsoftonline.com/40431729-d276-4582-abb4-01e21c8b58fe/v2.0
TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_TRUSTED_AUDIENCES='{"issuer": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/40431729-d276-4582-abb4-01e21c8b58fe/v2.0","audiences": ["d8ea5612-6745-47bc-b9fe-5024b1ca18fe", "082a9391-b645-4278-a16e-3cf54fb1bcf0"]}'
```

Now you can restart your Tenzir Platform stack and the system will redirect you to a Microsoft login page when you next log in to the Tenzir UI.

## Single-user Mode

In some scenarios handling multiple users is not necessary for the Tenzir
Platform. For example for purely local instances used for development or
experimentation, or where access is already gated through some
external mechanism.

For these situations, the Tenzir Platform offers the single-user mode.
In this mode, the Tenzir Platform itself acts as the identity provider,
and creates a static, global admin user with no password.

To stress, this means that everyone who can reach the Tenzir Platform will have
full access to every Tenzir Node and every workspace, so this is not suitable
for generic production deployments.

To use the single-user mode, we recommend starting from [this](https://github.com/tenzir/platform/tree/main/examples/localdev)
example setup. This example is already fully configured and can run
as-is, skipping the manual configuration described in the sections below.

### Tenzir Platform API

In terms of configuration, the `platform` service needs to be put into
single-user mode by setting the `TENANT_MANAGER_AUTH__SINGLE_USER_MODE`
environment variable to true.

Additionally, the platform needs to have additional configuration that
would usually be configured in the external identity provider, in particular
the issuer url it should use for signing its own JWTs and the allowed redirect
URLs and audiences of the UI and CLI:

```sh
TENANT_MANAGER_AUTH__SINGLE_USER_MODE=true

TENANT_MANAGER_AUTH__ISSUER_URL=http://platform:5000/oidc
TENANT_MANAGER_AUTH__PUBLIC_BASE_URL=${TENZIR_PLATFORM_API_ENDPOINT}/oidc
TENANT_MANAGER_AUTH__APP_AUDIENCE=tenzir-app
TENANT_MANAGER_AUTH__APP_REDIRECT_URLS=${TENZIR_PLATFORM_UI_ENDPOINT}/login/oauth/callback
TENANT_MANAGER_AUTH__CLI_AUDIENCE=tenzir-cli
```

### Tenzir UI

The Tenzir UI needs to be pointed to the `platform` service as the new identity
provider.

Since the single-user mode does not provide true user authentication,
the corresponding client secret is also not truly secret but set to the
static string "xxxx".

```sh
PRIVATE_OIDC_PROVIDER_NAME=tenzir
PRIVATE_OIDC_PROVIDER_CLIENT_ID=tenzir-app
PRIVATE_OIDC_PROVIDER_CLIENT_SECRET=xxxx
PRIVATE_OIDC_PROVIDER_ISSUER_URL=http://platform:5000/oidc
```

### Tenzir Platform CLI

In single-user mode, the Tenzir Platform CLI can be set to non-interactive
mode by adding the `TENZIR_PLATFORM_CLI_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variable.

Note that when running the Tenzir Platform inside a docker compose stack,
in single-user mode the CLI must run the same docker compose stack as
the platform. When running outside of docker compose, the requirement is that
the CLI must be able to establish a network connection to the configured
ISSUER_URL.

```sh
TENZIR_PLATFORM_CLI_CLIENT_ID=tenzir-cli
TENZIR_PLATFORM_CLI_CLIENT_SECRET=xxxx
TENZIR_PLATFORM_CLI_ISSUER_URL=http://platform:5000/oidc
```

## Advanced Topics

### Custom Scopes

By default, the Tenzir Platform requests the `profile email openid offline_access` scopes
when you log in. To adjust this, set the `PUBLIC_OIDC_SCOPES` environment variable
to a space-separated list of scope names.

### Profile Pictures

To include custom profile pictures, include a `picture` claim in the returned
ID token that contains a URL to the image file.

The Tenzir Platform reads that claim and uses it as the profile picture in
the top right corner of the user interface, or falls back to a default image if the
claim isn't present.

### Refresh Tokens

The Tenzir Platform supports the use of refresh tokens and by default requests
the `offline_access` scope to automatically refresh sessions after the initial
ID token has expired. To this end, the `offline_access` scope is requested by
default.

Unfortunately, the OIDC spec is ambiguous on the precise semantics of
the `offline_access` scope, and Keycloak's interpretation differs
from most other OIDC providers: it always includes refresh tokens by default,
and adds additional permissions to the token when the `offline_access` scope
is requested.

Therefore, some organizations forbid the use of tokens with `offline_access`
permissions for security reasons. In that case, add an environment variable
`PUBLIC_OIDC_SCOPES=profile email oidc` to the `app` environment to explicitly
remove the scope request. The bundled Docker Compose file in this directory does this
by default.
