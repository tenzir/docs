title: Overview

The **Tenzir Platform** acts as a fleet management control plane for Tenzir
Nodes. Use its web interface to explore data, create pipelines, and build
dashboards.

:::tip[Sovereign Edition required]
This guide shows you how to set up the platform on your own premises with the
[Sovereign Edition](https://tenzir.com/pricing). We also offer a hosted cloud
version of the platform at [app.tenzir.com](https://app.tenzir.com).

## Services

The platform integrates three types of services, as the diagram below illustrates:

![Platform Services](./platform-services.svg)

1. **Internal**: Tenzir provides the (gray) internal services. They are core to the platform's operation.
2. **External**: You provide the (blue) external services. We do not ship these, so you must bring your own.
3. **Configurable**: You can use our bundled (yellow) configurable services or provide your own.

## Deployment options

There exist two ways to deploy the platform:

1. **Cloud**: Deploy the platform on a cloud provider.
2. **On-premises**: Deploy the platform on your own infrastructure.

### Get started in the cloud

For Amazon, read our [AWS deployment
guide](/guides/platform-setup/deploy-on-aws) for an integrated approach to
deploying the platform services in your own account using a **CloudFormation**
template.

For Azure and GCP, we are still working on providing turnkey deployment setups.

### Get started on your own premises

Follow these steps to set up the platform on your own premises:

import { Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<Steps>

1. [Choose a scenario](/guides/platform-setup/choose-a-scenario): we package
   several deployment options that match common deployments.

2. Configure the services: you must set up the external API endpoints so nodes
   and browsers can interact with the platform.
   - [Configure reverse proxy](/guides/platform-setup/configure-reverse-proxy)
   - [Configure internal services](/guides/platform-setup/configure-internal-services)
   - [Configure identity provider](/guides/platform-setup/configure-identity-provider)
   - [Configure database](/guides/platform-setup/configure-database)
   - [Configure blob storage](/guides/platform-setup/configure-blob-storage)

   You may skip some steps depending on your chosen scenario.

3. [Run the platform](/guides/platform-setup/run-the-platform): After you create
   a configuration, start the platform.

</Steps>

:::note[Usage guides]
The above guides cover platform deployment. For platform management, see our
user-centric guides:

1. [Configure workspaces](/guides/platform-management/configure-workspaces)
2. [Configure dashboards](/guides/platform-management/configure-dashboards)
3. [Use ephemeral nodes](/guides/platform-management/use-ephemeral-nodes)
