title: Configure workspaces
---

Workspaces in the [platform](/explanations/architecture/platform) logically
group nodes, secrets, and dashboards.

You can configure workspaces in two ways:

1. **Dynamically**: Create, update, or delete workspaces using the command
   line interface. 👉 Suited for ad-hoc workspace management.
2. **Statically**: Pre-define workspaces declaratively in configuration
   files. 👉 Suited for GitOps-based infrastructure management.

## Manage workspaces dynamically

Our [platform command-line utility](/reference/platform/command-line-interface)
supports managing at runtime.

## Define static workspaces

You pre-define **static workspaces** declaratively in configuration files. This
"as-code" approach differs from the dynamic management approach, which you
manage with the [command line
interface](/reference/platform/command-line-interface).

Here's a minimal example of a static workspace configuration:

```yaml title="workspaces.yaml"
workspaces:
  static0: # Unique workspace identifier
    name: Tenzir # Display name in the UI
    category: Statically Configured Workspaces # Grouping category in the UI
    icon-url: https://storage.googleapis.com/tenzir-public-data/icons/tenzir-logo-square.svg
    auth-rules:
      - { "auth_fn": "auth_allow_all" } # Authentication rule (this allows everyone)
```

The `auth-rules` section defines who can access the workspace. The example above
uses `auth_allow_all`. This rule grants access to everyone.

:::tip[Generating Auth Rules] Use the `print-auth-rule`
[CLI](/reference/platform/command-line-interface) command to easily generate
auth rules in the correct format:

```bash
tenzir-platform tools print-auth-rule allow-all
```

:::

The `platform` service in a Tenzir Platform deployment uses the
`WORKSPACE_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable to locate its static workspace
configuration file:

```yaml title="docker-compose.yaml"
services:
  platform:
    environment:
      # Other environment variables...
      - WORKSPACE_CONFIG_FILE=/etc/tenzir/workspaces.yaml
    volumes:
      # Mount your config file.
      - ./workspaces.yaml:/etc/tenzir/workspaces.yaml
```

This example mounts a local `workspaces.yaml` file into the container. The
platform service then accesses it at the location that
`WORKSPACE_CONFIG_FILE` specifies.
