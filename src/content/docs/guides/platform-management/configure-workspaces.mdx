title: Configure workspaces
---

Workspaces in the [platform](/explanations/architecture/platform) logically
group nodes, secrets, and dashboards.

You can configure workspaces in two ways:

1. **Dynamically**: Create, update, or delete workspaces using the command
   line interface. ðŸ‘‰ Suited for ad-hoc workspace management.
2. **Statically**: Pre-define workspaces declaratively in configuration
   files. ðŸ‘‰ Suited for GitOps-based infrastructure management.

## Manage workspaces dynamically

The Tenzir Platform CLI allows administrators to create, modify, and delete
workspaces on demand.

:::caution[On-premise setup required]
This CLI functionality requires an on-premise platform deployment, available
with the [Sovereign Edition](https://tenzir.com/pricing).
:::

Only local platform administrators can manage workspaces dynamically. The
[`TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_ADMIN_RULES` variable](/guides/platform-setup/configure-identity-provider)
defines who's an administrator in your platform deployment.

### Creating and managing workspaces

You can create workspaces for either individual users or organizations. When
you create a user workspace, it's automatically configured with access for that
specific user. Organization workspaces start with no access rules, giving you
full control over who can access them.

For a detailed overview, of the available commands, take a look at our
[CLI reference documentation](/reference/platform/command-line-interface).

### Example: Setting up an organization workspace

Let's walk through creating a workspace for the fictional "Scrooge & Marley Counting House" organization:

1. **Create the organization workspace:**

   ```bash
   tenzir-platform admin create-workspace organization scrooge-marley --name "Scrooge & Marley Counting House"
   ```

   This creates a workspace with the organization ID `scrooge-marley` and the display name "Scrooge & Marley Counting House".

2. **Configure access for employees with company email addresses:**

   ```bash
   tenzir-platform admin add-auth-rule email-domain <workspace_id> <connection> '@scroogemarley.com'
   ```

3. **Add a specific user:**

   The specific format of the user id depends on the OIDC provider you configured.
   The provided id must match the `sub` of the generated OIDC token in order
   to allow access to the workspace.

   ```bash
   tenzir-platform admin add-auth-rule user <workspace_id> 'sub|12345678901'
   ```

4. **Grant access to users with the "accountant" role:**

   ```bash
   tenzir-platform admin add-auth-rule organization-role <workspace_id> <connection> roles accountant organization scrooge-marley
   ```

If you later need to remove the workspace:

```bash
tenzir-platform admin delete-workspace <workspace_id>
```

### Understanding access control

Access rules determine who can enter a workspace. Users gain access to the
workspace if they match any configured rule. Think of rules as multiple keys to
the same door.

The platform supports various rule types, from allowing everyone to restricting
access to specific users or organization members.

For a complete reference of all available authentication rules and their parameters,
see the [CLI reference documentation](/reference/platform/command-line-interface#configure-access-rules).

## Define static workspaces

You pre-define **static workspaces** declaratively in configuration files. This
"as-code" approach differs from the dynamic management approach, which you
manage with the [command line
interface](/reference/platform/command-line-interface).

Here's a minimal example of a static workspace configuration:

```yaml title="workspaces.yaml"
workspaces:
  static0: # Unique workspace identifier
    name: Tenzir # Display name in the UI
    category: Statically Configured Workspaces # Grouping category in the UI
    icon-url: https://storage.googleapis.com/tenzir-public-data/icons/tenzir-logo-square.svg
    auth-rules:
      - { "auth_fn": "auth_allow_all" } # Authentication rule (this allows everyone)
```

The `auth-rules` section defines who can access the workspace. The example above
uses `auth_allow_all`. This rule grants access to everyone.

:::tip[Generating Auth Rules] Use the `print-auth-rule`
[CLI](/reference/platform/command-line-interface) command to easily generate
auth rules in the correct format:

```bash
tenzir-platform tools print-auth-rule allow-all
```

:::

The `platform` service in a Tenzir Platform deployment uses the
`WORKSPACE_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable to locate its static workspace
configuration file:

```yaml title="docker-compose.yaml"
services:
  platform:
    environment:
      # Other environment variables...
      - WORKSPACE_CONFIG_FILE=/etc/tenzir/workspaces.yaml
    volumes:
      # Mount your config file.
      - ./workspaces.yaml:/etc/tenzir/workspaces.yaml
```

This example mounts a local `workspaces.yaml` file into the container. The
platform service then accesses it at the location that
`WORKSPACE_CONFIG_FILE` specifies.
