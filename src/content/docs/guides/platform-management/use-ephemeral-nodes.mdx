title: Use ephemeral nodes
---

An **ephemeral node** is ideal for temporary or auto-scaling deployments. It
is a temporary node that you do not have to provision manually first, and
it disappears from the workspace when the connection to the platform ends.

Using ephemeral nodes requires that you define a *workspace token*, a shared
secret that you pass to the node so that it can self-register. You can define a
workspace token in your workspace configuration:

```yaml title="workspaces.yaml"
workspaces:
  static0:
    name: Tenzir
    # Other configuration...
    token: wsk_e9ee76d4faf4b213745dd5c99a9be11f501d7009ded63f2d5NmDS38vXR
```

:::caution
Workspace tokens have a specific format. Do not create them manually!
Use the `tenzir-platform tools generate-workspace-token` command to create
valid tokens.
:::

For improved security, store the token in a separate file:

```yaml title="workspaces.yaml"
workspaces:
  static0:
    name: Tenzir
    # Other configuration...
    token-file: /run/secrets/workspace_token
```

This approach works well when you use Docker or Kubernetes secrets.

### Deploy an ephemeral node

To spawn an ephemeral node, create configuration file with the workspace token:

```yaml title="config.yaml"
tenzir:
  token: wsk_e9ee76d4faf4b213745dd5c99a9be11f501d7009ded63f2d5NmDS38vXR
  platform-control-endpoint: http://tenzir-platform.example.org:3001
```

Then run the node with this configuration:

```bash
tenzir-node --config=config.yaml
```
