title: Use ephemeral nodes
---

An **ephemeral node** is ideal for temporary or auto-scaling deployments. It
is a temporary node that you do not have to provision manually first, and
it disappears from the workspace when the connection to the platform ends.

Using ephemeral nodes requires that you define a _workspace token_, a shared
secret that you pass to the node so that it can self-register. You can define a
workspace token in your workspace configuration:

```yaml title="workspaces.yaml"
workspaces:
  static0:
    name: Tenzir
    # Other configuration...
    token: wsk_e9ee76d4faf4b213745dd5c99a9be11f501d7009ded63f2d5NmDS38vXR
```

:::caution
Workspace tokens have a specific format. Do not create them manually!
Use the `tenzir-platform tools generate-workspace-token` command to create
valid tokens, or read the _Workspace Token Format_ section below for more
details.
:::

For improved security, store the token in a separate file:

```yaml title="workspaces.yaml"
workspaces:
  static0:
    name: Tenzir
    # Other configuration...
    token-file: /run/secrets/workspace_token
```

This approach works well when you use Docker or Kubernetes secrets.

### Deploy an ephemeral node

:::note
Workspace tokens require a Tenzir Node v5.1.6 or later.
:::

To spawn an ephemeral node, create a configuration file with the workspace token:

```yaml title="config.yaml"
tenzir:
  token: wsk_e9ee76d4faf4b213745dd5c99a9be11f501d7009ded63f2d5NmDS38vXR
  platform-control-endpoint: http://tenzir-platform.example.org:3001
```

Then run the node with this configuration:

```bash
tenzir-node --config=config.yaml
```

### Workspace Token Format

A valid workspace token consists of the string `wsk_`, followed by 24 bytes
of hex-encoded randomness, followed by the base58-encoded workspace id.

More precisely, a workspace token is encoded according to the following logic:

```python
import os
import base58

def print_workspace_token(workspace_id: str) -> None:
    base58_workspace_id = base58.b58encode(workspace_id.encode()).decode()
    random_bytes = os.urandom(24).hex()
    print(f"wsk_{random_bytes}{base58_workspace_id}")
```

The `tenzir-platform tools generate-workspace-token` implements exactly this logic
to generate a valid workspace key. However, if you want to avoid external
dependencies for generating the key, any other tool that can print a string in
the format described above can be used as well.
