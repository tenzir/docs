title: Get data from the network
---

This guide shows you how to receive data directly from network sources using
TQL. You'll learn to listen on TCP and UDP sockets for incoming data and
capture raw packets from network interfaces.

## TCP sockets

The [Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol)
provides reliable, ordered byte streams. Use TCP when you need guaranteed
delivery and message ordering.

### Listen for connections

Start a TCP server that accepts incoming connections:

```tql
from "tcp://0.0.0.0:9000" {
  read_json
}
```

This listens on all interfaces (`0.0.0.0`) on port 9000. Specify a parsing
pipeline to convert incoming bytes to events.

### Connect to a remote server

Act as a TCP client by connecting to an existing server:

```tql
from "tcp://192.168.1.100:9000", connect=true {
  read_json
}
```

### Enable TLS

Secure your TCP connections with TLS:

```tql
from "tcp://0.0.0.0:9443",
  tls=true,
  certfile="/path/to/cert.pem",
  keyfile="/path/to/key.pem" {
  read_json
}
```

For testing, generate a self-signed certificate:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 \
  -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem \
  -days 365 -nodes
```

For detailed TCP options, see the [TCP integration](/integrations/tcp) page.

## UDP sockets

The [User Datagram Protocol (UDP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol)
is a connectionless protocol ideal for high-volume, loss-tolerant data like
syslog messages or metrics.

### Receive UDP datagrams

Use [`from_udp`](/reference/operators/from_udp) to receive UDP messages as
structured events:

```tql
from_udp "0.0.0.0:514"
```

Each datagram becomes an event with `data` (the message content) and `peer`
(the sender's address) fields.

### Parse syslog messages

A common pattern is receiving syslog over UDP:

```tql
from_udp "0.0.0.0:514"
this = data.parse_syslog()
```

### Process sender information

Include the sender's IP address in your events:

```tql
from_udp "0.0.0.0:514"
message = data.parse_syslog()
source_ip = peer.ip()
```

For detailed UDP options, see the [UDP integration](/integrations/udp) page.

## Packet capture

Capture raw network packets from a network interface card (NIC) for deep packet
inspection or network forensics.

### List available interfaces

Find which network interfaces are available:

```tql
nics
select name, addresses, up
where up
```

```tql
{name: "eth0", addresses: ["192.168.1.100", "fe80::1"], up: true}
{name: "lo", addresses: ["127.0.0.1", "::1"], up: true}
```

### Capture packets

Use [`load_nic`](/reference/operators/load_nic) with
[`read_pcap`](/reference/operators/read_pcap) to capture and parse packets:

```tql
load_nic "eth0"
read_pcap
```

Each packet becomes an event with metadata and the raw packet data:

```tql
{
  linktype: 1,
  timestamp: 2024-01-15T10:30:45.123456Z,
  captured_packet_length: 74,
  original_packet_length: 74,
  data: "ABY88f1tZJ7zvttmCABFAAA8...",
}
```

### Decapsulate packets

Extract protocol headers from captured packets using the
[`decapsulate`](/reference/functions/decapsulate) function:

```tql
load_nic "eth0"
read_pcap
packet = decapsulate(this)
select packet
```

```tql
{
  packet: {
    ether: {src: "64-9E-F3-BE-DB-66", dst: "00-16-3C-F1-FD-6D", type: 2048},
    ip: {src: "192.168.1.100", dst: "10.0.0.1", type: 6},
    tcp: {src_port: 54321, dst_port: 443},
    community_id: "1:YXWfTYEyYLKVv5Ge4WqijUnKTrM=",
  },
}
```

The `community_id` field provides a
[Community ID](https://github.com/corelight/community-id-spec) hash for
correlating network flows across different tools.

### Filter by BPF expression

Apply Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) expressions to capture only specific
traffic:

```tql
load_nic "eth0", filter="tcp port 443"
read_pcap
```

### Read PCAP files

The same parsing works for PCAP files:

```tql
from_file "capture.pcap"
read_pcap
packet = decapsulate(this)
```

For detailed packet capture options, see the
[Network Interface integration](/integrations/nic) page.

## Common patterns

### Syslog collection with enrichment

Receive syslog, parse it, and add source metadata:

```tql
from_udp "0.0.0.0:514"
syslog = data.parse_syslog()
this = {
  ...syslog,
  collector: {
    source_ip: peer.ip(),
    received_at: now(),
  },
}
```

### Multi-protocol receiver

Accept data on multiple ports with different formats:

```tql
// JSON over TCP on port 9000
from "tcp://0.0.0.0:9000" {
  read_json
}
```

```tql
// Syslog over UDP on port 514
from_udp "0.0.0.0:514"
this = data.parse_syslog()
```

### Network flow extraction

Capture packets and extract flow-level summaries:

```tql
load_nic "eth0"
read_pcap
packet = decapsulate(this)
select
  timestamp,
  src_ip=packet.ip.src,
  dst_ip=packet.ip.dst,
  src_port=packet.tcp.src_port? else packet.udp.src_port?,
  dst_port=packet.tcp.dst_port? else packet.udp.dst_port?,
  community_id=packet.community_id
```
