title: Read from message brokers
---

This guide shows you how to receive events from message brokers using TQL.
You'll learn to subscribe to topics and queues from Apache Kafka (including
Amazon MSK), AMQP-based brokers (like RabbitMQ), Amazon SQS, and Google Cloud
Pub/Sub.

## Apache Kafka

[Apache Kafka](/integrations/kafka) is a distributed message broker commonly
used for high-throughput event streaming. Use
[`from_kafka`](/reference/operators/from_kafka) to subscribe to topics.

### Subscribe to a topic

```tql
from_kafka "security-events"
```

By default, `from_kafka` produces events with the raw message in a `message`
field. Parse the message content to extract structured data:

```tql
from_kafka "security-events"
this = message.parse_json()
```

### Control the read offset

The `offset` option determines where to start reading:

| Value         | Description                             |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `"beginning"` | Start from the oldest available message |
| `"end"`       | Start from the newest messages only     |
| `"stored"`    | Resume from the last committed offset   |
| `1000`        | Start from a specific offset            |
| `-100`        | Start 100 messages before the end       |

```tql
from_kafka "events", offset="beginning"
```

### Configure consumer groups

Kafka uses consumer groups to distribute messages across multiple consumers.
Specify a group ID for coordinated consumption:

```tql
from_kafka "events", group_id="tenzir-ingest"
```

### Connect to Amazon MSK

[Amazon MSK](/integrations/amazon/msk) is a managed Kafka service. Use the
`aws_iam` option for IAM authentication:

```tql
from_kafka "security-logs",
  options={"bootstrap.servers": "my-cluster.kafka.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:9098"},
  aws_iam={region: "us-east-1"}
```

## AMQP (RabbitMQ)

[AMQP](/integrations/amqp) is supported by brokers like RabbitMQ. Use AMQP URLs with
[`from`](/reference/operators/from) or
[`load_amqp`](/reference/operators/load_amqp) directly.

### Receive from a queue

```tql
from "amqp://user:pass@broker:5672/vhost"
```

The URL structure is `amqp://user:password@host:port/vhost`. Configure
additional options like exchange and routing key in the operator parameters.

## Amazon SQS

[Amazon SQS](/integrations/amazon/sqs) is a managed message queue. Use [`load_sqs`](/reference/operators/load_sqs) or the `sqs://`
URL scheme.

### Receive from a queue

```tql
from "sqs://my-queue" {
  read_json
}
```

### Configure polling

Use long polling to reduce API calls and receive messages in batches:

```tql
from "sqs://my-queue", poll_interval=5s {
  read_json
}
```

SQS automatically deletes messages after successful receipt.

## Google Cloud Pub/Sub

[Google Cloud Pub/Sub](/integrations/google/cloud-pubsub) provides managed
messaging for Google Cloud. Use
[`from_google_cloud_pubsub`](/reference/operators/from_google_cloud_pubsub) to
subscribe.

### Receive from a subscription

```tql
from_google_cloud_pubsub project_id="my-project",
  subscription_id="my-subscription"
parsed = message.parse_json()
```

The operator produces events with a `message` field containing the raw message
content. Parse it to extract structured data.
