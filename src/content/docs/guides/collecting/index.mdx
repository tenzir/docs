title: Overview

This guide provides an overview of data collection in TQL. You'll learn about
the different approaches for ingesting data from various sources.

TQL provides two types of input operators:

- **`from_*` operators** like [`from_file`](/reference/operators/from_file) and
  [`from_http`](/reference/operators/from_http) read bytes and parse them using
  a [subpipeline](/reference/programs/#parsing-subpipelines).

- **Direct event operators** like [`from_kafka`](/reference/operators/from_kafka)
  and [`from_udp`](/reference/operators/from_udp) produce structured events
  directly without an intermediate byte stream.

:::caution[Migration note]
The `from_*` family of operators supersedes the older `load_*` operators that
produce bytes. While `load_*` operators remain supported, prefer the newer
`from_*` variants which provide a more unified experience with built-in format
inference.

For example, `from_file "data.csv"` replaces `load_file "data.csv" | read_csv`.

## Collection patterns

Different data sources require different collection approaches.

### Files and cloud storage

Read local files, watch directories for changes, or access cloud storage:

```tql
// Single file with automatic format detection
from_file "/var/log/app.json"

// Watch a directory for new files
from_file "/incoming/*.csv", watch=true

// Cloud storage with glob patterns
from_file "s3://bucket/data/**/*.parquet"
```

See the [file reading guide](/guides/collecting/read-and-watch-files) for
details.

### HTTP and APIs

Fetch data from web APIs with authentication, pagination, and retry handling:

```tql
from_http "https://api.example.com/events",
  headers={"Authorization": "Bearer " + secret("API_TOKEN")}
```

See the [HTTP and API guide](/guides/collecting/fetch-via-http-and-apis) for
pagination patterns and advanced configurations.

### Message brokers

Subscribe to topics or queues from Apache Kafka, AMQP, Amazon SQS, and Google
Cloud Pub/Sub:

```tql
from_kafka "security-events", offset="end"
```

See the [message broker guide](/guides/collecting/read-from-message-brokers)
for broker-specific configurations.

### Network data

Receive data over TCP or UDP sockets, or capture packets from network
interfaces:

```tql
// UDP syslog receiver
from_udp "0.0.0.0:514"

// TCP with TLS
from "tcp://0.0.0.0:8443", tls=true
```

See the [network data guide](/guides/collecting/get-data-from-the-network) for
socket configurations and packet capture.

## Sending data to destinations

For routing data to outputs, see the [Routing guides](/guides/routing/send-to-destinations),
which cover destination operators, file output, load balancing, and pipeline
connections.
