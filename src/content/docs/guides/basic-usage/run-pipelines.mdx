title: Run pipelines
---

You can run a [pipeline](/explanations/architecture/pipeline) via the
[platform](https://app.tenzir.com), on the command line using the `tenzir`
binary, or as code via the configuration file.

## In the platform

Run a pipeline by writing typing it in the editor and hitting the _Run_ button.

The following invariants apply:

1. You must start with an input operator
2. The browser is always the output operator

The diagram below illustrates these mechanics:

![Pipeline in the Browser](run-pipelines/pipeline-browser.svg)

For example, write `from {x: 42}` and click _Run_ to see a single event show up.

## On the command line

On the command line, run `tenzir <pipeline>` where `<pipeline>` is the
definition of the pipeline.

If the pipeline expects events as its input, an implicit `load_stdin |
read_json` will be prepended. If it expects bytes instead, only `load_stdin` is
prepended. Likewise, if the pipeline outputs events, an implicit `write_json |
save_stdout` will be appended. If it outputs bytes instead, only `save_stdout`
is appended.

The diagram below illustrates these mechanics:

For example, run `tenzir 'version | drop dependencies'` to see a single event in
the terminal:

```tql
{
  version: "5.0.1+g847fcc6334",
  tag: "g847fcc6334",
  major: 5,
  minor: 0,
  patch: 1,
  features: [
    "chart_limit",
    "modules",
    "tql2_from",
    "exact_schema",
    "tql2_only",
  ],
  build: {
    type: "Release",
    tree_hash: "ef28a81eb124cc46a646250d1fb17390",
    assertions: false,
    sanitizers: {
      address: false,
      undefined_behavior: false,
    },
  },
}
```

You could also render the output differently by choosing a different format:

```sh
tenzir 'version | drop dependencies | write_csv'
tenzir 'version | drop dependencies | write_ssv'
tenzir 'version | drop dependencies | write_parquet | save_file "version.parquet'
```

Instead of passing the pipeline description to the `tenzir` executable, you can
also load the definition from a file via `-f`:

```sh
tenzir -f pipeline.tql
```

This will interpret the file contents as pipeline and run it.

## As Code

In addition to running pipelines interactively, you can also deploy _pipelines as
code (PaC)_. This infrastructure-as-code-like method differs from the app-based
deployment in two ways:

1. Pipelines deployed as code always start with the Tenzir node, ensuring
   continuous operation.
2. To safeguard them, deletion via the user interface is disallowed.

Here's a an example of deploying a pipeline through your configuration:

```yaml title="<prefix>/etc/tenzir/tenzir.yaml"
tenzir:
  pipelines:
    # A unique identifier for the pipeline that's used for metrics, diagnostics,
    # and API calls interacting with the pipeline.
    suricata-over-tcp:
      # An optional user-facing name for the pipeline. Defaults to the id.
      name: Onboard Suricata from TCP
      # An optional user-facing description of the pipeline.
      description: |
        Onboards Suricata EVE JSON from TCP port 34343.
      # The definition of the pipeline. Configured pipelines that fail to start
      # cause the node to fail to start.
      definition: |
        load_tcp "0.0.0.0:34343"
        read_suricata
        publish "suricata"
      # Pipelines that encounter an error stop running and show an error state.
      # This option causes pipelines to automatically restart when they
      # encounter an error instead. The first restart happens immediately, and
      # subsequent restarts after the configured delay, defaulting to 1 minute.
      # The following values are valid for this option:
      # - Omit the option, or set it to null or false to disable.
      # - Set the option to true to enable with the default delay of 1 minute.
      # - Set the option to a valid duration to enable with a custom delay.
      restart-on-error: 1 minute
      # Add a list of labels that are shown in the pipeline overview page at
      # app.tenzir.com.
      labels:
        - Suricata
        - Onboarding
      # Disable the pipeline.
      disabled: false
      # Pipelines that are unstoppable will run automatically and indefinitely.
      # They are not able to pause or stop.
      # If they do complete, they will end up in a failed state.
      # If `restart-on-error` is enabled, they will restart after the specified
      # duration.
      unstoppable: true
```
