This guide shows you how to publish your package. You'll learn how to contribute
to the Tenzir Community Library and how to set up your own package repository
with automated testing.

## Contribute to the Community Library

The [Tenzir Community Library](https://github.com/tenzir/library) is a
collection of open-source packages that appear in the
[Tenzir Library](https://app.tenzir.com/library). Contributing your package
makes it discoverable and installable by the entire community.

### Prepare your package

Before submitting, verify your package meets these requirements:

- Has a complete `package.yaml` with descriptive metadata
- Includes at least one example in the `examples/` directory
- Has passing tests that cover the main functionality
- Uses an SVG icon for `package_icon` (host it in your package directory)

### Submit a pull request

<Steps>

1. Fork the [tenzir/library](https://github.com/tenzir/library) repository.

2. Add your package directory to the repository root (see structure below).

3. Push your changes and open a pull request.

4. The CI pipeline automatically detects your package and runs its tests.

5. After review and merge, your package appears in the Tenzir Library.

</Steps>

<FileTree>

  - your-package/
    - package.yaml

    - operators/
    - pipelines/
    - tests/

</FileTree>

:::caution[Get feedback first]
Before opening a pull request, consider sharing your package on our
[Discord server](/discord) in the `show-and-tell` channel. Community feedback
helps refine your package before it reaches a wider audience.

## Host your own package repository

For private packages or custom distribution, host packages in your own Git
repository. This approach works well for organization-specific integrations or
packages under development.

### Repository structure

Organize your repository with one package per directory:

<FileTree>

- my-packages/
  - .github/
    - workflows/
      - test.yml CI workflow
    - scripts/
      - detect-touched-packages.sh
  - package-one/
    - package.yaml
    - operators/
    - tests/
  - package-two/
    - package.yaml
    - pipelines/
    - tests/

</FileTree>

### Set up CI with GitHub Actions

Create a workflow that tests packages on pull requests and pushes. The following
workflow mirrors the approach used in the Community Library.

```yaml title=".github/workflows/test.yml"
name: Test Packages

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Install uv
        uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v5

      - name: Detect touched packages
        id: detect
        run: |
          packages=$(.github/scripts/detect-touched-packages.sh "${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }}")
          echo "packages=$packages" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"

      - name: Run tests
        if: steps.detect.outputs.packages != ''
        run: uvx tenzir-test ${{ steps.detect.outputs.packages }}
```

### Detect changed packages

Create a script that identifies which packages changed in a pull request:

```bash title=".github/scripts/detect-touched-packages.sh"
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

base_sha="${1:-}"

if [[ -n "$base_sha" ]]; then
  changed_files=$(git diff --name-only "$base_sha"...HEAD)
else
  changed_files=$(git ls-files)
fi

echo "$changed_files" \
  | xargs -I{} dirname {} \
  | sort -u \
  | while read -r dir; do
      if [[ -f "$dir/package.yaml" ]]; then
        echo "$dir"
      fi
    done
```

Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x .github/scripts/detect-touched-packages.sh
```
