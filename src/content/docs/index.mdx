**Tenzir** is the data pipeline engine for security teams. Collect, transform,
enrich, and route your telemetry, all in one place.

![End-to-end pipeline](./end-to-end-pipeline.svg)

Write pipelines in [TQL](/explanations/language/), a simple yet powerful query
language designed for security data. No complex infrastructure to manage, no steep learning curve,
just pipelines that work. Go from raw logs to actionable insights in minutes,
whether you're normalizing events, enriching with threat intel, or routing to
your SIEM. Tenzir is open source and built to scale, from a single node to
distributed deployments handling millions of events per second.

## How are the docs organized?

We structure our docs using the [Diátaxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/)—four
types of content, each serving a different need:

<InteractiveDocsStructure />

- [Guides](/guides/): Practical step-by-step instructions to help you achieve a
  specific goal. Most useful when you're trying to get something done.
- [Reference](/reference/): Nitty-gritty technical descriptions of how Tenzir
  works. Most useful when you need detailed information about Tenzir's building
  blocks.
- [Explanations](/explanations/): Big-picture explanations of higher-level
  Tenzir concepts. Most useful for building understanding of a particular topic.
- [Tutorials](/tutorials/): Learning-oriented lessons that take you through a
  series of steps to complete a project. Most useful when you want to get
  started.
