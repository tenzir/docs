**Tenzir** is the data pipeline engine for security teams. Our pipelines
collect, shape, normalize, optimize, enrich, store, replay, and route your
telemetry data.

## How are the docs organized?

We structure our docs using the [Diátaxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/)—four
types of content, each serving a different need:

<InteractiveDocsStructure />

- **Guides**: Practical step-by-step instructions to help you achieve a
  specific goal. Most useful when you're trying to get something done.
- **Reference**: Nitty-gritty technical descriptions of how Tenzir works. Most
  useful when you need detailed information about Tenzir's building blocks.
- **Explanations**: Big-picture explanations of higher-level Tenzir concepts.
  Most useful for building understanding of a particular topic.
- **Tutorials**: Learning-oriented lessons that take you through a series of
  steps to complete a project. Most useful when you want to get started.
